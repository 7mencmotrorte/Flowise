The built-in Snipping Tool lets you snap, save, annotate and share screenshots of all or a portion of your screen. It can also record a video -- with sound -- of a window on your desktop. The easiest way to call up the Snipping Tool is by using the keyboard shortcut **Windows key + Shift +** **S**.

Once you take your screenshot, it will be saved to your clipboard and show up momentarily as a notification in the lower-right corner of your screen. Click the notification to open the screenshot in the Snipping Tool app to annotate, save or share it. (If you miss the notification, open the notification panel and you'll see it sitting there.)
 
To start recording a video, you need to highlight a portion of your screen and then click Start from the small panel at the top of your screen. You can choose to record system audio or sound from the microphone -- or both.

If you search for the Snipping Tool from the taskbar or open it from the Start menu's alphabetical list of apps, it will open a small window instead of the tiny panel at the top of the screen. From here, you need to click the **New** button in the upper left to initiate a screen capture and open the small panel. It's an extra step to proceed this way, but it also lets you delay a screenshot by 3, 5 or 10 seconds.
 
After opening the Snipping Tool, click the **New** button to begin the screenshot process. The default snip type is rectangular, but you can also take free-form, full-screen and window snips.
 
You can also set the PrtScn button to open the Snipping Tool by going to **Settings > Accessibility > Keyboard** and toggling on **Use the Print screen key to open screen capture**.
 
To capture your entire screen and automatically save the screenshot, tap the **Windows key + Print Screen key**. Your screen will briefly go dim to indicate you've just taken a screenshot, and the screenshot will be saved to the **Pictures > Screenshots** folder.
 
To take a quick screenshot of the active window, use the keyboard shortcut **Alt + PrtScn**. This will snap your currently active window and copy the screenshot to the clipboard. You'll need to open the shot in an image editor to save it.
 
You can use the Game bar to snap a screenshot, whether you're in the middle of playing a game or not. First, you'll need to enable the Game bar from the settings page by making sure you've toggled on **Record game clips, screenshots and broadcasts using Game bar**. Once enabled, hit the **Windows key + G key** to call up the Game bar. From here, you can click the screenshot button in the Game bar or use the default keyboard shortcut **Windows key + Alt + PrtScn**to snap a full-screen screenshot. To set your own Game bar screenshot keyboard shortcut, to **Settings > Gaming > Game bar**.
 
If you're rocking a Microsoft Surface device, you can use the physical (well, sort of physical) buttons to take a screenshot of your entire screen -- similar to how you would take a screenshot on any other phone or tablet. To do this, hold down the Windows logo touch button at the bottom of your Surface screen and hit the physical volume-down button on the side of the tablet. The screen will dim briefly and the screenshot will be automatically saved to the **Pictures > Screenshots** folder.
 
The title says it all. I customized different keyboard shortcuts. But every single shortcut config still keeps bringing up windows snipping tool. This is Windows 11. Is this a known bug? Are there any workarounds?
 
This is true. It arose because Microsoft changed things when it released Windows 11. So the problem is with Microsoft rather than Evernote. I'm sure that there could be some work done by Evernote to resolve the issue but since the workaround is trivial I anticipate that it will be sometime in arriving.
 
Meanwhile, I recommend Win+Shift+S which will open the Windows snipping tool with the cross hairs (just like the Evernote process used to have). Highlight the screen area you wish to snip. Then open the note where you want this to be captured (if it is a new note tap Ctrl+N) and tap Ctrl+V to paste the clip into the note.
 
To make things a bit less hassle I reset the New Note shortcut to Ctrl+Alt+N. Ctrl+N often launches a new window for whichever application has focus so doesn't always open a new note in Evernote unless Evernote has focus. Ctrl+Alt+N usually work regardless...
 
Ive withheld upgrading to the latest Evernote for years because of how I used evernote in my workflow, I upgraded earlier today and now my Evernote screenshots wont work on Win11 and it has becomes a sort of muscle memory for me to take screenshots using Evernote for around decade. Now it doesn't work =/
 
Use the Windows snipper (Win+Shift+S), capture the screen area and paste into a new note. If you wish, make the Windows screen capture directory an Evernpte Import Folder and then Win+Shift+S will work exactly as the Evernote screen capture previously did.
 
I would hardly call the original workaround "trivial." It is three keystrokes instead of one. But this last tip is brilliant and works well enough: add the Windows screen capture directory (C:\Users[User Name]\Pictures\Screenshots) as an Evernote Import Folder. Thank you agsteele!

Need to take a screenshot on your Windows PC? Whether you want to capture the full screen or just one window or area, there are several quick and easy ways to take screenshots in Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows 8. This wikiHow article will teach you how to use keyboard shortcuts (including the Print Screen key), the Snipping Tool, and the Xbox Game Bar to screen capture any area of your Windows desktop.
 
I don't need a screenshot of my problem. I have been trying to buy credits to play computer games but the Microsoft form will not give me the option to select my State, which is Victoria. I have reported this problem many times over the past few days but the problem remains.
 
To capture a screenshot on Windows 10, I simply hold down the Windows key, press Shift, and then click the 'S' key. Afterward, I'm able to select the specific area on the screen that I want to capture. This is always the easiest way for me and then I grab a subway specials today.
 
@Iceni\_777 you could maybe try shift+windows key+S in that respective order. Do not press them at the same time and keep the previous key down when pressing the next one. After that you can select the part of the screen you want to screenshot and then in order to save it you need to click on the notification that will pop up. The notification will open a new tab and then you have to manually save it. I hope this helped!
 
Recommend a totally free and safe ( developed by a commercial brand) snipping tool. It can capture for various needs - take notes, add elements, etc. Hot keys can be customized according to your habits. Most importantly, it's safe and free of all kinds of ads, which is quite annoying when I use other free software.
 
To take a screenshot on Windows 10, press the "Windows Key + PrtScn" to capture the entire screen and save it to the "Screenshots" folder. Press "Alt + PrtScn" to capture the active window, and paste it using "Ctrl + V." Use the "Snipping Tool" for more options. For Windows 10 keys, use **Hype-stKey**, a partner of Microsoft.
 
I've got DirectShow based screen capture software. Internally it calls CopyScreenToBitmap function to grab screen. Then the picture is compressed by ffdshow.It works fine as a desktop application, but as window service, on certain computers it does not work (black picture). I've set 'Allow service to interact with desktop' and run that service on current user account.Any ideas what could be wrong?
 
As I understand it, a change was made in Vista that moved services onto a separate desktop from the console user. While you have ticked the box that "allows access" to the desktop, I think you still have to pragmatically switch your service to use that desktop.
 
Trying to use the Windows game bar to record (see -to-video-screen-capture-windows-10), I find that it only records the most recent windows clicked on before hitting the game bar hotkey (perhaps I am using the feature incorrectly).
 
My actual use case is that I have dual monitors: one large, where I want to record several windows to demonstrate something, and a laptop screen, where I have a script I need to read from (so need to capture audio as well). I then edit these videos in the Photos video editor. I want to record the entire screen of the larger monitor. How can I do this in Windows 10?
 
Hi Joaquin - the only thing that comes to mind off hand is to make a layout (maybe in a template file ) with the page and four views set up to fill the screen and capture that all at once with ViewCaptureToFile.
 
Yes, it has never been updated since. I took it down hoping I would make updated version that uses fully Rhino 5 capacities but so far it was not a high priority as it still does what I mostly need. So the version you have from 2012 still is the latest. It does not let you capture multiple viewports, just NamedViews.
 
Thanks for the fast response!
