Our film scanning department consists of top of the range drum scanners capable of capturing exceptional detail and tone; we also have flatbed and CCD scanning to accommodate a range of film-based and printed materials.
 
Metro has built a reputation for volume archive photo scans, scanning complete photo film libraries and vintage material from any origination, including photo prints and slides, to large format negatives.
 
Drum scanning enables you to create impeccable large-scale colour, black and white or Gicle prints. Drum scanners continue to be the tool of choice for high-end film applications because drum scanners are capable of capturing very subtle details in film originals, producing exceptionally smooth tonal gradients.
 
While not as high quality as our drum scans, we also offer CCD scans from both medium format and 35mm film frames. These are suitable for printing up to A3 (20mb CCD scan) or A4(10mb CCD scan) or on screen use.

Mobile tickets do not need phone service to be displayed, however they do need service to be purchased. Therefore you must purchase and activate your ticket before boarding Metrolink or a bus connection if you are connecting to a Metrolink train.

You will not be able to make any purchases or changes until your phone service is restored.
