Replying to news agency ANI when asked about Ranbir's Taj Mahal picture and if the couple is planning to visit it anytime soon Alia blushed. She said, "Hahaha... Arjun is a cartoon. Ranbir is back now...Currently, there are no plans of visiting the Taj Mahal...but ya I really like that picture. It's a sweet one."
 
Recently on Instagram, Arjun had shared a post teasing Alia. He had shared a photo and written, "When Ranbir Kapoor the artist emerged inspired by the Taj + Me..." Reacting to it Rakul Preet Singh had commented, "Haha finally you both saw the Taj." Arjun had replied, "@rakulpreet ya he saw it with me first instead of going with Alia (laughing emoji)."
 
Alia and Ranbir have been in a relationship for several years now. They fell in love during the shooting of their first project together, Brahmastra. The film, directed by Ayan Mukerji, also features Amitabh Bachchan, Akkineni Nagarjuna, and Mouni Roy.
 
Brahmastra trilogy has been produced by Fox Star Studios, Karan Johar's Dharma Productions, Prime Focus and Starlight Pictures. The first part of the movie will be released on September 9, 2022. The second and third parts of 'Brahmastra' are due in 2024 and 2026.
 
Alia is currently awaiting the release of Gangubai Kathiawadi, which will hit the theatres on Friday. Directed by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the film also features Ajay Devgn, Vijay Raaz, Seema Pahwa and Shantanu Maheshwari.
 
In the story of Arjun he could focus all attention and hit the eye of the bird target. Our current finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman while chasin $3Trillion economy managed to damage the existing one.

Well, Pushpa made a terrific presence at the box office despite many odds including that of covid, negative talk, and much more. And the film posted not only enormous profits for the producers, but it also opened up new markets for Allu Arjun as well as he got huge appreciation from many quarters. Well, and the Amul cartoon sums it up all.
 
Actor **Arjun Rampal**, it seems, has not taken too kindly to the extensive criticism and thousands of jokes about Ra.One. The actor made his feelings known and set the record straight with a simple cartoon which he shared with his followers on Twitter, yesterday.
 
Most of the films produced by the Walt Disney Animation Studio receive major releases all around the world. But amidst a host of higher-profile releases, there was actually one Disney co-production that only had a one-week engagement in the United States. It's not because the film is bad - it was a critical success in its home country of India. But it's also so different than most Disney films that it truly stands out.
 
Arjun: The Warrior Prince was released. The Arnab Chaudhuri-directed film was a critical success in India, where it received a much wider release than it did in the States. It was a co-production between Walt Disney Pictures and UTV Motion Pictures. As with many films that fall in the Disney canon, the story of the film can be traced back to cultural folklore and mythology. The plot is framed as the tale of Prince Arjuna being told to the young Prince Uttar of Virata, an adaptation of the first four books of the ancient Indian epic, Mahabharata.
 
Arjun is the talented and good-hearted son of King Pandu, and one of the Pandava family. Of his brothers, Arjuna proves to be a prodigy in combat- becoming a gifted swordsman and showcasing such incredible archery skills that he wins the hand of Princess Draupadi in marriage. The machinations of a rival family, the Kuravas, lead to all the Pandavas being exiled from their kingdom. While most of his family remains together, Arjuna ventures into the north alone - learning the ways of tapasya and even earning a bow from Shiva himself. As the Prince listens, he is faced with his own epic threat in the form of an invading army.
 
Like more recognizable entries in the Disney canon, Arjun adapts a classic story for a modern audience, but it stands out from the pack. Although the character animation can be stiff at times, it shines when it shows off the expansive and majestic settings. The animation becomes far more lively during the many action scenes, when it's closest to the fluid movement of other Disney cartoons. It's one of the most action-packed films the animation studio has ever been associated with, featuring multiple massive battles. It also features a powerful soundtrack, featuring some huge songs in dramatic moments.
 
It is unique among Disney films for just how surprisingly violent it can be. While Disney films have featured some large battles over the years (like the Hun army in Mulan) , they're toned down to appeal to children. Gore is kept to an absolute minimum, with almost any amount of blood being removed from scenes that would otherwise have lots of it. That's not the case in Arjun: The Warrior Prince. The film features combat as a chief part of life, and shows a certain respect for the artistry that can be found in swordplay, archery and warfare.
 
But violence is also shown to be an absolutely vicious affair in the film, with scores of minor characters being killed brutally on-screen. The hero even uses his weapons in the climax to behead members of the opposing army, with splashes of blood flashing across the screen with each fallen soldier. At one point, Arjun unleashes a torrent of arrows, killing multiple men on screen - including with bursts of blood shooting out of their chests. It's intense, in a way that the rest of the output from Disney never is.
 
It feels inspired by Bollywood cinema epics, which compliments the tone but embraces a type of bombastic action that Disney has never approached to this degree. Even just as a unique footnote in animation history, Arjun: The Warrior Prince is fascinating, an amalgamation of two cultural traditions to make something wholly unique in the history of Disney animation.
 
Soon as Amul shared the tributed online, lead actor of 'Pushpa', Allu Arjun couldn't stop himself from reacting, he seemed to be delighted by the cartoon and wrote: "Allu to Mallu to Amullu Arjun (sic)."
 
The film has been renewed for a sequel which is expected to hit the theatres during the end of this year, in December. In recent interviews, Rashmika Mandanna has assured the fans that the sequel, Pushpa 2 (Pushpa: The Rule) is going to be even bigger and better. The second part will bring back Sukumar as the director along with actors Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna.
 
Jenna, thanks for this great response. You call attention to the strange status of these "immortal" stories: they are immortal insofar as they can be brought back to life, resuscitated by the next generation of children's media. And then there is also the strangeness of Turner using tradition to brand itself in India, when the mobilized tradition is itself a brand and a media company.
 
Fascinating post. I am struck by the way that the press release obviously (to me) avoids referring to these epics as "Hindu," preferring instead to describe them as part of an "Indian storytelling heritage." Not only do we find Turner International participating in the blurring or re-articulating of relations between (Hindu) religion and (Indian) national culture, but I also wonder how much of this decision is prompted by Turner International's reluctance to be associated with religion. It is hard to imagine the Cartoon Network in the U.S. broadcasting a series devoted to Biblical storytelling. So perhaps we find here other work being performed by the religion/culture distinction, as well, allowing Turner International to celebrate a "cultural" tradition without promoting a particularistic "religious" perspective. It's culture, not religion, so it's okay! (and harmless?!).
 
I am not a fan of Hindu nationalism, and I can see where Isaac is coming from. However, I feel that mythology is a very rich basis for cultural tradition. There are great stories that deserve retelling in various epics, including Hindu, Judeo-Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, Jain epics.
 
The question of Hindu nationalism is a complicated one here, and while there are surely ways in which the ACK has tended to conflate the categories "Hindu" and "Indian," the series has also (as Kartik points out) featured comics that retell Buddhist tales and tales of various historical figures (themselves often Hindu, as with Gandhiji and Shivaji, both featured in the clip here).
 
I wonder whether some of the attention devoted to the ACK's possible Hindu bias owes its energy to a very different pictorialization of the Hindu epics: the famed Sagar Ramayana that aired on Doordarshan in 1987-88. This televised epic has often been associated with the rise of the BJP and, and in particular with the politicization of Ayodhya, the city where Ram is held to have been born. Part of my interest in this cartoon of a Ramayana episode is in noting the distance-- aesthetically, commercially, and politically-- between it and its epic antecedent.
 
That Turner International would prefer "Indian" to "Hindu" heritage definitely accords
