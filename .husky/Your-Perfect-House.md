One of my favorite Christmas presents this year was The Perfect House. This is an elegant, charming memoir/travel diary by architect Withold Rybczynski chronicling his week spent living in the Villa Saraceno, built in the 1540s, and still standing tall, as well as his visits to ten Palladian villas in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy.
 
Which in my terms, for use as a rental, would mean a house with warm, considerate owners with sensibilities like yours, to greet you on arrival, and who in their manner are discreet, never overbearing and available for questions small and large.
 
The house must be historic, converted with sensitivity and sophistication into a restoration that balances the integrity of traditional elements, such as oak-beamed ceilings and vaulted terracotta ceilings, with modern comforts, including outstanding bathrooms and a private pool.
 
The garden must be a highlight, with flowering plants, fruit trees and/or vegetable and herb gardens. The pool must be set on its own terrace, with pergola or umbrellas for relaxing or dining. And everything must be so charming and enjoyable that you may find it hard to go sightseeing.
 
When you think of your dream home, what do you imagine (PDF)? When you close your eyes, do you see a single-family home, townhome, or a condo? Do you want a modern home with an open floorplan or something more traditional? Set aside some time to write down all of the things you want in your new home. Consider key factors such as things you "must have" in your new home to be happy. This can be anything from the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to the size of the kitchen and backyard.
 
Make a separate list of features you think would be "nice to have" but you don't necessarily need, such as an office, backyard patio or porch, two-car garage, fireplace, or sliding glass doors. Having these lists handy will make the home buying process a lot simpler when seeing the latest home.
 
Before looking at potential homes, it's crucial to determine a realistic budget. Once you decide on your financial plan, stick to it. Consult your list of "must have" and "nice to have" features when considering how much you can afford to spend.
 
This also means doing diligent research on homes you're considering and factoring in moving expenses, and any potential renovations, into your budget. It's essential to consider unexpected factors such as longer commute times, or whether or not your future home will have energy efficient appliances. All of these things add up and, without a budget in mind, you can easily spend beyond the limit you've set.

 
After determining a loose housing budget, you'll need to decide how much you'll be comfortable paying each month. If you have to take out a mortgage, consider saving for a down-payment. A mortgage calculator can help you estimate your monthly mortgage payment. Don't forget to include expenses like homeowners insurance and property taxes when looking at mortgage estimates.

 
Once you have a number, contact a lender to begin the pre-qualified process. Since the real estate market can be very competitive, getting pre-qualified for a loan will help you stand out among other home buyers.
 Additionally, determining a pricing range will help you to narrow down your search results, allowing you to focus on something equally important: the location of your new home.

 
Equally important when considering purchasing a home is considering your future home's location. What kind of neighborhood do you want to live in? Be sure to research school districts, and commute times to work and to any other areas you frequent.
 
Living in a great location and within a good school district may boost the overall value of your home. While considering selling your home may be the furthest thing from your mind right now, it's essential to consider your home's appeal.
 
Go for a drive around the area and get an overall feel of the neighborhood. Does it seem clean? Are the people friendly? Is this a community you can see yourself, or your family, being a part of? It may even be worth checking in with your neighbors-to-be to see what they think of the area. Create a list of pros and cons to help keep your search objective.
 
Additionally, a real estate agent can negotiate with the seller on your behalf and handle the necessary paperwork. If you're a first-time home buyer, working with a real estate agent can make the home buying process smoother and more efficient.
 
Keep in mind that not every house you look at will be perfect. When it's time to make an offer on a home, it's important to try and visualize living there. Can you imagine your furniture in the living room and dining room? Can you see yourself preparing breakfast in the kitchen?
 You may also want to make changes, such as giving the interior a fresh coat of paint. Try to remain flexible: These changes will allow you to give your new home a personal flair and a chance to make it your very own. After you spruce up the place, your new place will feel like home.

 
Once you've picked, the next step is making an offer. Don't be afraid to negotiate the seller's original price. If you're unsure of how to proceed, your real estate agent can handle the negotiations on your behalf.
 If your offer is accepted, the next step is to get a home inspection. A home inspector provides you with an unbiased opinion on the home's condition. The money you'll spend on a home inspection could potentially save you money down the road if it turns out your home needs expensive repairs. After you get your home inspection report, you and your real estate agent can re-negotiate your initial offer based on your inspection results.

 
A preapproval is based on a review of income and asset information you provide, your credit report and an automated underwriting system review. The issuance of a preapproval letter is not a loan commitment or a guarantee for loan approval. We may offer a loan commitment after you submit an application and we perform a final underwriting review, including verification of any information provided, property valuation and, if applicable, investor approval, which may result in a change to the terms of your preapproval. Preapprovals are not available on all products and may expire after 90 days. Contact a Home Lending Advisor for details.
