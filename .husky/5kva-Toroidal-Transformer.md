Toroidal transformers are also called as a power voltage regulator, with a to-15 voltage regulated or 24-hole voltage regulator. It is also known as high voltage transformers, especially in high-temperature transformers, if it is a power voltage regulator, or any other electronic device.
 
The Phoenix Inverter Smart is an efficient and reliable inverter. Built on our proven and field tested Phoenix inverter platform, it now comes with a new slimmer design and full metal casing. Models are available in 1600VA, 2000VA and 3000VA for 12, 24 or 48V systems.

Bluetooth is built-in, and makes setting up your high power inverter easier than ever before.
Configure alarms, alarm relay, voltage cut-off, output voltage, frequency, eco-mode and more, all from within VictronConnect.
 
The full bridge plus toroidal transformer topology has proven its reliability over many years. The inverters are short circuit proof and protected against overheating, whether due to overload or high ambient temperature.
 
A remote on/off switch or relay contact can be connected to a two pole connector. Alternatively, the H terminal (left) of the two pole connector can be switched to battery plus, or the L terminal (right) of the two pole connector can be switched to battery minus (or the chassis of a vehicle, for example).
 
For our low power inverters we recommend our Filax Automatic Transfer Switch. The Filax features a very short switchover time (less than 20 milliseconds) so that computers and other electronic equipment will continue to operate without disruption. Alternatively use a MultiPlus with built-in transfer switch.
