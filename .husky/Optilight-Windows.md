OptiLight is the new brand on the roof window market, offering a high quality product at an affordable price. The modern technology of woodworking and preparation of raw materials, the quality control at every stage of the production process and quality tests carried out by independent laboratories are a guarantee of high quality in OptiLight roof windows.
 
The Optilight 550 x 780mm roof window only sold by the Loft Shop is we believe currently the lowest cost centre pivot roof window in the UK. If you find an equivelent centre pivot roof window at a lower price, please provide an official quote or invoice and match that price.
 
**Optilight Roof Windows**  
  
Large effective glazed area, facilitates room illumination. Pivot structure and functional handle placed in the bottom part of the sash ensures comfortable use and operation.
 
The window has a large effective glazing area, which allows more light to enter the room. All windows are double glazed, and use a single chambered construction and acoustic properties. Space between panes is filled with inert gas. The internal pane is coated with a heat reflecting low-emission layer. It helps to reduce heat loss during winter and overheating during summer.
 
Design of external metal cladding elements used in OptiLight windows add to their modern and aestheticall pleasing appearance. A wide and comprehensive range of accessories raises window usage comfort providing the possibility of light control, heat reduction and energy savings

**High quality wood**  
  
Wooden elements of the OptiLight windows are made from especially sorted, highest quality pinewood which is bonded in layers, impregnated, and coated with an ecological acrylic finish. The wood is protected on the outer surface with weather and UV resistant aluminium profiles.
 
**Metal cladding**  
  
Metal cladding elements of OptiLight windows are made of suitably thick aluminium sheet which adds to their resistance to mechanical damage during transport, installation and window usage. The sheet is coated with polyester which is fully weather-resistant.
 
**Structure**  
  
OptiLight windows have a centre-pivoting construction. The hinges installed in the middle of the window allow the sash to be opened in a range of positions and to be rotated up to 180 degrees. The handle design enables tight closing and two positions of micro ventilation. The handle positioned at the bottom of the sash makes using the window easier and more comfortable, irrespective of the height at which the window is installed.
 
**Air inlet**  
  
The air inlet of OptiLight VA type efficiency is up to 20 [m3/h]. It is the air quantity, which flows into the room through the window with 78cm or 114 cm width and pressure difference of 10 Pa. Windows with 78cm width and bigger have in the air-inlet slat 2 openings. In windows with 55 and 66 cm width, air-inlet efficiency will be respectively lower and is 15 [m3/h]. The windows with 55 and 66 cm width are equipped with air-inlet slat with one opening.
 
Although I had not heard of this roof window brand before the price was very competitive and I now have 3 of them safely installed side by side in my loft (I am using the space as a temporary study before we convert the loft at a later stage)
 
When it comes to SkyLight windows cheap doesn't mean poor quality. The brand stands for plastic windows that have a very good ratio between price and quality. So if you are looking for skylights at a reasonable price (where is no alternative for other types of glass or custom-made products) and fact that there are only limited quantity of accessories that would fit to that window is acceptable for you, Skylight windows are good choice for you. Ten-year warranty and the ability to send spare parts (even if the waiting time is a bit long sometimes) also increases the security that the service life of the skylight is planned for a long time.
 
In terms of price, OptiLight is a really interesting product and at the same time it's quality is very good. A big experience and FAKRO technology go with OptiLight. There is also a wide range of accessories that may not be available at as good a price as the windows themselves, but if you save money on skylights then buying only accessories is not such a big cost.
Lower price is possible to obtain, because no special requests are taken by Kronmat - they sell only products and sizes available in the standard offer. To compare - well-known manufacturers such as VELUX, FAKRO or Roto invest a lot to offer as wide range of products as possible and they meet all customers' needs. That causes the costs, but customer can be sure that there's a lot really well designed products to find. A cheap manufacturer can not - and doesn't want to - do that. Strategy of such compans is actually about selling as cheaply as possible. A cheap manufacturer will achieve this in the long term only if the quality of the product is at least satisfactory, otherwise his product will not be able to last long. Our previous customer reviews confirm quite clearly that a good price and good quality go hand in hand when it comes to both SkyLight and OptiLight
