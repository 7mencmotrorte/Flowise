You will come across many leaders in your life, some in office, others outside. In my experience until now, I have been able to identify two kinds of leaders: self-starter and dhakka starter. One moves by himself, the other needs to be pushed. One is self-inspired, the other needs constant inspiration from outside. One acts, the other hesitates.

Look at the way the natural world works: plants are not pushed to grow; animals are not forced to hunt; nobody follows-up the flowers for their bloom. Nature and everything in it is a self-starter. The dhakka starters in nature always lose in the battle of evolution, and become extinct. The same natural law applies to you. Move yourself, inspire yourself to act. Save yourself from extinction.
 
technically speaking you CAN dhakka start an older auto car but you are risking destroying your torque converter so i'm not going to tell you how. most modern cars don't allow you to do so. my suggestion is to make sure your battery is in good condition, as well as your starter. this way you avoid the headaches.
 
I think you can do it. Put the gears in ' N' , push the car like manuals one & on getting the momentum put it in ' D4' . What will happen thereafter? I dont know bcoz I am not ready take such a risk with my car.

u can start ur automatic car by dhaka but it's really risky 
u can do this only by toe ur car with some other car at take the speed around 50km to 60km and then it'll start 
but i suggest u instead of doing all this just toe ur car and take it to some workshop
