Electrical engineering primarily convers the study of electric circuits, power systems, electrical machines, power electronics, control system, and many more. Electrical engineering uses formulae and mathematical equations to explain and prove the truth of concepts. These formulae and equations are very useful in understanding the behavior of electrical systems and helps to perform the different calculations in practice.

The subatomic property of substances by virtue of which the substances show the electrical behavior is called **electric charge**. The electric charge is denoted by *Q (or q)*, and is measured in **Coulombs (C)**. The electric charge is carried two elementary atomic particles namely electrons and protons, where an electron carries a negative charge while a proton carries a positive charge.
 
Voltage, also called **potential difference**, is defined as the difference of electric potentials of two points in an electrical circuit. It is measured in **Volt (V)**. It may also be defined as the amount of work done required to move a unit charge from one point to another in an electric circuit, i.e.,
 
The directed flow of electric charge, more specifically electrons, through a conductor is known as **electric current**. Electric current is denoted by I (or i), and is measured in **Ampere (A)**. Electrical current may also be defined as the time rate of change of charge, i.e.,
 
Where, *ρ* is a constant called **resistivity** or **specific resistance** of the material. The resistivity is defined as the property of material by which it opposes the flow of current through it.

**Power factor** is measure of utilization of electric power in an ac electric circuit. It provides information about the part of total power utilized by load in an electrical system. It is given by the ratio of active power to the apparent power, i.e.,
 
The property of a substance of storing electric charge in the form of electrostatic field is called **capacitance** of the substance. The circuit element used to introduce the capacitance effect in an electric circuit is called **capacitor**. The capacitance of capacitor is denoted by *C,* and measured in **Farad (F)**.
 
Inductance is a property of materials by which they store electrical energy in the form of magnetic field. The element is known as inductor. The inductance is denoted by *L* and measured in **Henry (H)**. It is given by the ratio of magnetic flux linkage and current as,
 
The space around an electrically charge body in which a test charge experiences a force of attraction or repulsion is known as **electric field**. The strength of force acting on the charge placed in the field is called **electric field intensity**. It is denoted by *E* and is measured in **Newton per coulomb (N/C)**.
 
In this article, we listed all the important formulae and equations of basic electrical engineering. Also, we defined each quantity for your reference. Every electrical engineer must know all these formulae because they are frequently used in different calculations.
 
All of the formulas in the Formula wheel can be derived from the above 2 basic formulas using a little algebra. In fact this is what I typically do. I derive whatever formula I need starting with the 2 basic formulas and derive the needed formula. Probably most electrical engineers do this as well I would dare say. Still it is nice to see these formulas layed out in this wheel format. It shows the power of learning just 2 simple formulas.
 
Math, physics, and algebra are critical to everything an electrician does, whether taking measurements or calculating voltages and power. Anyone looking to become an electrician needs a background in basic mathematics. That forms the core math used in routine measurements and calculations at work. Below is a look at different kinds of math used in electrical careers:
 
Electricians use trigonometry and basic geometry principles during installations, repair, and maintenance. Trigonometry is a math branch dealing with the sides and angles of triangles. Electricians can apply tangent functions to determine the ideal angles to bend conduit sections along the proper wiring route.
 
Algebra allows electricians to work comfortably with unknown variables when calculating the known. There are many situations when electricians and electrical engineers call on their algebraic skills to solve complex problems. Introductory algebra learned in high school is the starting point. Electricians have more robust equations and variables to factor, featuring Boolean algebra and numbers with real and imaginary roots.
 
You need thorough understanding of different kinds of math to become an electrician. Logarithms, calculus, statistics, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry are essential for advanced electrical calculations. This career also requires various other skills, including problem-solving, time management, working with others, communication skills, honesty, and patience.
 
In any system of measurements, a single set of units is usually not sufficient for all the computations involved in electrical repair and maintenance. Small distances, for example, can usually be measured in inches, but larger distances are more meaningfully expressed in feet, yards, or miles. Since electrical values often vary from numbers that are a millionth part of a basic unit of measurement to very large values, it is often necessary to use a wide range of numbers to represent the values of such units as volts, amperes, or ohms. A series of prefixes which appear with the name of the unit have been devised for the various multiples or sub multiples of the basic units. There are 12 of these prefixes, which are also known as conversion factors. Four of the most commonly used prefixes used in electrical work with a short definition of each are as follows:

**Note:** Resistance cannot be measured in an operating circuit, so Ohm's Law is especially useful when it needs to be calculated. Rather than shutting off the circuit to measure resistance, a technician can determine R using the above variation of Ohm's Law.
 
Try a few sample calculations based on a simple series circuit, which includes just one source of voltage (battery) and resistance (light). Two values are known in each example. Use Ohm's Law to calculate the third.
 
When Ohm published his formula in 1827, his key finding was that the amount of electric current flowing through a conductor is **directly proportional** to the voltage imposed on it. In other words, one volt of pressure is required to push one amp of current through one ohm of resistance.
 
In direct current (dc) circuits, a lower than normal current measurement could mean that the voltage has decreased, or circuit resistance has increased. Possible causes for increased resistance are poor or loose connections, corrosion and/or damaged components.
 
Loads within a circuit draw on electrical current. Loads can be any sort of component: small electrical devices, computers, household appliances or a large motor. Most of these components (loads) have a nameplate or informational sticker attached. These nameplates provide safety certification and multiple reference numbers.
 
Technicians refer to nameplates on components to learn standard voltage and current values. During testing, if technicians find that customary values do not register on their digital multimeters or clamp meters, they can use Ohm's Law to detect what part of a circuit is faltering and from that determine where a problem may lie.
 
Atoms remain bound together by forces of attraction between an atom's nucleus and electrons in its outer shell. When influenced by voltage, atoms in a circuit begin to reform and their components exert a potential of attraction known as a potential difference. Mutually attracted loose electrons move toward protons, creating a flow of electrons (current). Any material in the circuit that restricts this flow is considered resistance.

Because LBME Apprentices come from a wide variety of occupations and because Related Training Courses complement the Apprentice's On-The-Job Training (OJT), this course is primarily lecture with accompanying homework assignments using Delmar's Standard Textbook of Electricity and the American Electrician's Handbook, to provide students with a solid, introductory knowledge base in electrical theory and calculations.
