It installs nothing, it is portable, it allows you to hide any update including drivers. This Software makes no changes to the normal windows update or your system (except for the updates you allow it to install) but does use the Windows update service, once you have hidden your updates and installed others you want, be sure to go into Windows Services and stop the Windows update service and then set it to disabled, or it will install the updates you hid using the other software.
 
Press , then type gpedit.msc and press . Once you get the Local Group Policy Editor like in the screenshot above, navigate to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Device Installation** and in the right pane double-click on the **Specify search order for device driver installation** option which will present you with the following dialog:
 
If you are unable to run gpedit.msc because you don't have a Pro version of Windows, then create the associated registry key manually using regedit.exe or by running the following command from the command prompt as Administrator:
 
Finally, please note that this might not prevent automatic installation of companion applications (things like Alienware Control Center, Intel's CPU/GPU DRM services, HP printer and scanner applications, etc).
 
Those companion apps are categorized as software "devices" (each of them has a unique ID), and they are automatically installed from Windows Store when you install the drivers, unless you take steps to block their installation beforehand.

Ive had a problem for about a month now where windows is replacing my video drivers. when i play games or go on the web my screen will turn black and give me a error when I launch adrenaline. I don't know what to do, I've tried so many solutions like ddu, and blocking windows from auto updating but nothing works. I just want to play
 
Once you complete the above steps, Windows will exclude any driver updates when searching for system updates. To re-enable the driver updates in the future, follow the same steps above and set the Do not include drivers with Windows Updates policy to Not configured.
 
Since editing the registry is risky, you should only use this method if the previous ones don't work. If you use this method, make sure you back up all the registry files or create a restore point just in case.
 
Restart your PC for the changes to take effect. Following that, Windows will no longer install driver updates on its own. If you want to re-enable the driver updates at any point, follow the same steps above and change the value data for SearchOrderConfig to 1 before restarting your PC.
 
Under the **Automatic** option there are two checkboxes: **Automatically delivered during Windows Upgrades** and **Automatically delivered to all applicable systems**. **Automatic** is the default setting for all new shipping labels.
 
When the first checkbox is selected, the driver is classified as a **Dynamic Update** (a term that applies to upgrade scenarios). Windows automatically preloads drivers in this category when upgrading the OS.
 
When the second checkbox is selected, the driver is downloaded and installed automatically on all applicable systems once it is released. All **Automatic** drivers must first have been evaluated by Microsoft through Driver Flighting.
 
If one exists, Windows installs it on the device. Then, during the next daily scan of Windows Update, Windows searches for a more up-to-date version of the driver. This can take up to 24 hours from when the device is plugged in.
 
Starting in Windows 10, version 2004, Windows does not search for a **Manual** driver when an **Automatic** driver is not available. For info on how to access **Manual** drivers, see the Windows Update section of this page.
 
When it fails to find a driver, Device Manager shows a button labeled **Search for updated drivers on Windows Update**, which opens the Settings app to the Windows Update page. To find this button, right-click a device and select **Properties**. On the **Driver** tab, select **Update Driver** and then **Search automatically for drivers**.
 
Starting in Windows 10, version 2004, Windows Update distributes only **Automatic** drivers for a system's devices. When **Manual** drivers are available for devices on the computer, the Windows Update page in the Settings app displays **View optional updates** .
 
Most drivers out there are garbage anyway. Asus Armory Crate is basically spyware. Logitech drivers are totally not needed (and for their G.Saitek line, they CAN'T make new drivers for their yokes and pedals - they don't have the source, which is from the Windows 9x/XP era anyway ... the company they bought their flight yoke and rudder pedal designs from - Mad Cats - can't fix it either. After all, that would mean getting a Windows XP install running, finding the 20-year-old compiler, etc.)
 
Ill try the tool but still intel needs to update the windows repository as well. the driver microsoft has is really old. nvidia drivers dont downgrade like this btw. so cant just be a microsoft problem.
 
same, it's a total nightmare, and this is not the first time, I have had this more than once in two months. 
I just got ARC to download the newest 101.5382 version.
the next windows 11 said I needed to reboot after a GFX update. I opened arc and its gone to some older 100 version.

I'm using a Limited User account under Windows XP, and I'm having a bit of trouble getting my Adaptoid (the most coveted N64 controller -> USB adapter, because of it's support for sending raw N64 controller commands + the fact that it's been discontinued) to work smoothly: as installed, the included software requires Administrator privileges to load the driver.
 
Presumably, it is possible to arrange for the driver to be loaded automatically when the Adaptoid is inserted by adding some stuff to the INF file for the driver (wishna1.inf): the question is, what stuff?
 
(It would also suit me just as well if the driver could be automatically loaded when anything attempted to open \Device\Wish\_NA1, or even to have it automatically loaded at every boot, really, but doing it on insertion seems like the right way.)
 
First of all, let's clarify that a USB device has a Plug & Play driver on Windows 2000 and higher, so services start modes are irrelevant. The driver will have an entry as a "service" in the registry, but its start mode is irrelevant here.
 
**Installing driver for the device:** This requires administrative privileges. This happens when you insert a USB device into a port for the first time. Windows goes over your .INF files to find one that matches your hardware. If the driver is WHQL-certified, it'll load automatically. Otherwise, you'd see the dreaded Add New Hardware wizard. If you're running as admin, a few clicks on Next should be enough to install it. Otherwise, better have that Administrator password ready.
 
**Loading the driver for the device:** Once the device is installed, the driver will be loaded each time **this** device is inserted into **this** USB port without requiring any additional user intervention. Ever noticed how a USB printer, camera or disk drive load much faster the second time you plug it in? That's because that's just loading, without installing.
 
I'm assuming when you insert the Adaptoid, you get an Add New Hardware wizard. If you point it manually to the installation directory, does the Adaptoid install and function? Does it appear in the Device Manager?
 
Software updates are a vital part of keeping your PC running its best. It's important to periodically check for updates since they are released at different intervals. To make things easier, your**Samsung PC** allows you to quickly check and apply updates. You can even customize the update options, so they'll only happen at times that are convenient for you.
 
The Samsung Update app allows you to download and install recommended apps and drivers for your Samsung PC. It is usually preinstalled on Samsung PCs, but you can **download it** from the Microsoft Store if you don't see it.
 
In most cases, your model will automatically be detected and the list of apps and drivers will indicate what is or is not up to date. Otherwise, enter your PC's model number in the Search bar, and then choose the appropriate software version, such as Windows 11 or Windows 10 v20H2.
 
**Pause updates:**Prevent any updates from automatically installing. On Windows 11, you'll have several time frames to choose from. On Windows 10, the default time frame is 7 days, and you can change the amount by going to Advanced options.
 
Updating the drivers for your Samsung PC can be done through either Samsung Update or Windows Update. However, getting drivers for any external devices you connect to your PC is also important. Windows Update may offer these drivers as well, but may mark them as optional.
 
If the external device or component you are connecting happens to also be made by Samsung, such as a monitor, you may find drivers for it from our **Download Center**. If drivers are not available from the Downlo
