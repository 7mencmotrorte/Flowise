I am personally against making an alt just to hide from someone. That let's them win. And yes, I have and am there . You could if you wanted to be nasty and the person CAN find you fairly easily (home, store, traditional hangouts) -- become completely invisible so you can be there and no one can see you - LOL. I haven't done this but ....
 
You can of course mute whoever is hassling you but they likely have alts that can also hassle you. Some folks seem to have an ARMY OF ALTS. Worse is the game play and time wasting. Really stupid. Most of us aren't 13 any longer.

Thanks Chic! I agree with you that alting is giving a victory to the abusive ones, but the army of alts you mention is what I'm up against and I try to be practical. By alting, I effectively gave up ten years of Inventory (and I am a serious shopper) - and I didn't take that step lightly.
 
I'll say this. putting tools in place to prevent it from being seens is ok, BUT if it prevents the LSL from seeing the true online status then it's a no go. I've got to many items out and about that RELY on these functions, LL learned from when they planned on nerfing it last time that if they did it would break content. maybe a viewer side change online would be a compermise for people such as yourselves. but this function to hide is not wanted, that was proven the last time
 
Still, I'm apparently not understanding the problem. Is it not possible to just block these "stalkers" and go on as if they don't exist? That is, does "block" not really work as advertised? Sure, they can know when we're online, but what do we care as long as we are no longer bothered to know of their existence because, after all, they're "stalkers."
 
Or do we want to**pretend to ourselves** that we're not horrible people for ignoring our friends and label that pretense "privacy" -- which is to say, our time is just too precious to bother interacting with those stalkers friends?
 
First of all Second Life is not JUST a social platform. Some folks here are working, not playing. Not everyone hangs around in sex sims or clubs. So there are SOME folks that would like their privacy so that they can work. It doesn't mean that they need to see a psychiatrist.

It gets old and tiring when folks (army of alts) try and chat you up -- in my case pretending to be a customer so that I pretty much have to be nice. The problem is that not everyone is good at the alt game -- or certainly not as good as they THINK they are. They drop the ball and show there hand. All in all its pretty boring and really a time waster.
 
There ARE legitimate uses of the online function such as delivering updates or in my case blogger boxes. We did manage to do all those things without the function for a long while though. Good for some, not so good for others.
 
Block only works for folks you KNOW not for the long line of folks that appear one by one as the "game" (their words - certainly not mine) continues. You could of course block those avatars also but there is not much point when a new one will just show up.

Do you have awesome software product ideas you would like to build? Do you need a great software engineer with over 20 years of experience on your team to help with different software projects? You are in the right place! As a one-person-army software engineer, I can build variants of software products from the ground up. Front-end Engineer, Backend-Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and Mobile Engineer, it will be very expensive to hire all of them, and the communication would be challenging. But if you hire me, I am the only person you need to talk to, and I can do all of it by myself. See some of my works here to get an idea of how wide the scope I can cover. Please get in touch with me via the following email if you are interested in the software development contracting service I provide: fangpen@launchplatform.com
 
I'll start with this: When I open Dropbox from my taskbar, there's no avatar for me to choose to set up Sync. If I go to my Dropbox account online, there's no Sync option under Preferences. Where am I going wrong? Thanks in advance.


 
As for your account online, you wouldn't be able to find your Sync tab, and preferences there, since these are tabs on the desktop app. Can you clarify what it is, that you're trying to achieve on your end?

Well, it looks like my Documents file is being correctly backed up and up to date, although I don't recall ever setting up the backup/sync process. In the process of figuring this out, though, at one point I was asked for my 12 words, which I had, but I was told that at least one of them was incorrect. Somehow, though, I was eventually able to check the backups to see that they are, in fact, accurate.

Will I have any issues in the future accessing my backups?

Does this mean I won't need Carbonite anymore?
 
One more (stupid?) question: There's constant reference to "external drive backups." If I haven't chosen an external drive, is my backup available on dropbox.com?
Another stupid question: The other day I copied my Documents folder to Dropbox using the blue icon. Obviously, that's not being backed up regularly. Can I just delete that?
 
When you say you copied your Documents folder using the blue icon, do you mean that you dragged and dropped the content there, or copied it? Provided that you have our Backup feature enabled, that should be happening automatically if you have chosen to backup Documents in your Dropbox folder.
 
Lastly, as for the Passcode, this is a feature found on our mobile app, and it's not available on desktop. When you follow the steps provided in the Help Center article, I'm assuming you don't see the option there, right?
 
Sorry for so many questions all at once.

1. Yes, I can see all my backups at the link you provided.
2. Before I realized that my Documents folder was being backed up automatically, I had copied it manually to Dropbox. I'm assuming that's a totally different folder than the "official" backup. Is that correct? I wasn't asking about deleting the icon.
3. Hmmm...Is there a reason why the passcode isn't available for the desktop? Doesn't that result in a lack of security?
4. Is the version the "External version: 278.7? If not, where would I find that? I just installed it this afternoon if that helps!
5. In the instructions I get to "Under the **Features** section, tap **Configure Passcode**," but there's no "Features" section!
Thanks for your patience.
 
It actually results in a false sense of security. Adding a passcode to the Dropbox application doesn't protect your files when they can be easily accessed on your computer through Explorer or Finder. Secure your computer so it requires a password to sign in, and you won't need to worry about the Dropbox application or your files.
