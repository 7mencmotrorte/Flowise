The snow leopard's main prey in Nepal - blue sheep - will provide one snow leopard with food for a week. Besides blue sheep, snow leopards feed on the ibex, Himalayan tahr, marmot, pika, hares, small rodents and game birds.
 
Snow leopards live in high-altitude mountainous terrain, usually at elevations of 3,000-4,500m. They prefer steep, broken landscapes such as cliffs, rocky outcrops and ravines. Snow leopards have short forelimbs and long hind legs, which allow them to traverse and stay agile in their steep and rugged environments.
 
Snow leopards are really well camouflaged! Their long fur and less distinctive markings that seem to change shape with body movement make identifying individual snow leopards difficult compared to other big cats like tigers, leopards and jaguars, which have more distinctive markings.
 
There could be as few as 4,000 leopards in the wild, however the exact number is unknown as they are extremely elusive. The main threats they face are habitat loss and deterioration, human-wildlife conflict, loss of prey, poaching for the illegal trade, and climate change. As a result, snow leopards really need our help, WWF is working alongside communities, Governments and other organisations to address some of the threats snow leopards face.
 
Snow leopards are well-adapted to high-elevated, cold climates. They have an extra-large nasal cavity, which warms the air they breathe. Their large paws have fur-covered foot pads that act like built-in "snowshoes." Their long body hair has an underlayer of dense fur that can be up to five inches thick. This plush, warm gray, white and black coat is colored to blend in with the snowy, rocky surroundings. They have a well-developed chest, short forelimbs, and a three-foot-long tail that helps them keep their balance. They are able to leap 50 feet horizontally and jump 20 feet vertically.
 
Snow leopards are solitary animals with the exception of females caring for offspring or males pairing up with females for mating season. They mate from January to March. A female gives birth in spring or early summer after a pregnancy of about 100 days. The kittens are born in a rocky shelter, which the mother lines with her fur for warmth. The litter can include as many as five babies, but the average is two or three. Cubs are very active by three months, but they may stay with their mom for one-and-a-half to almost two years.
 
The Zoo supports two snow leopards in Big Cat Country. The Saint Louis Zoo also participates in the Species Survival Plan for snow leopards. This is a cooperative breeding program, with a number of zoos working together to ensure the survival of the species. Learn more about how we are helping wildlife around the world.

 
**Zoo collection includes:** The Central Park Zoo is home to male and female Snow Leopard twins River and Summit (born June 2, 2013), who live in one habitat, and their mother's other younger cub Malala (born in 2014). The twins were the first two snow leopard cubs ever born at the zoo.

**Description:** Snow leopards are well adapted to the cold climate of their homeland. They have long body hair with an under-layer of dense fur that can be up to five inches thick. This plush coat is colored to blend in with the snowy, rocky surroundings: gray and white with black spots. They have a well-developed chest, short forelimbs, and a three-foot-long tail that helps them keep their balance. Snow leopards stand about two feet tall. Males weigh up to 120 pounds, while females are somewhat smaller, weighing up to 90 pounds. They have a relatively small head with a short, broad nose that has a large nasal cavity that passes cold air through and warms it. Huge paws have fur on the bottom that protects and cushions their feet for walking, climbing, and jumping. The furry paws also give the cat great traction on snow. Short, well-developed front legs and chest muscles help with balance when climbing. The snow leopard's incredibly long and beautiful tail also helps with balance and is sometimes as long as the cat's body. Smoky gray and blurred black markings provide the snow leopard with superb camouflage in the mountains.
 
**What do they eat:** Their favored prey are blue sheep and ibex (wild goats), but they also feed on domestic animals such as horses. Some of these animals are bigger than the snow leopards themselves. In fact, these cats can bring down prey three times their weight. Though large animals make up most of their diet, snow leopards also hunt smaller prey, including marmots, hares, and birds.
 
**Threats:** Endangered. It's been estimated that the wild population numbers only 4,500 to 7,500 animals. They are hunted for their coats as well as their bones, which are ground up and used in traditional Chinese medicine. They compete for food with people, who often kill snow leopard's favored prey. And when the cats turn to domestic livestock for food, they're often shot by ranchers.
 
The zoo will close early on Friday, August 9, 2024, to accommodate setup for Wild After Hours: Corks for Conservation (18+). The last entry into the grounds will be at 3:00 p.m. and the grounds will begin to be cleared at 4:00 p.m. Thank you for understanding.
 
**Indoor Gorilla Habitat:** From July 2 until approximately the end of the month, the western lowland gorilla troop will not be viewable in their indoor African Rainforest habitat while work is done on the viewing windows. The troop will be viewable in their outdoor habitat throughout the project (weather and animal participation permitting). The rest of the African Rainforest building will remain open and accessible throughout the project. Thank you for your understanding.
 
This reclusive cat is rarely seen in the wild, thanks to its ability to move silently and blend in with its surroundings. Preferring rocky outcroppings, a snow leopard moves through its territory on powerful legs that are capable of jumping 50 feet. A snow leopard is an expert hunter, able to kill prey three times its own weight.
 
Located near Tiger Taiga, the new snow leopard habitat will be sure to wow you! This new space offers our male snow leopards, Kimti and Meru, and female snow leopard, NeeCee, an engaging new environment.
 
Cats can be elusive, and snow leopards are masters of camouflage, able to bound up to 50 feet in one jump. Visit often to spot the snow leopard among the talus rock slope; you may even spot a cat bounding from rock to rock!
 
You are most likely to spot lounging leopards in the lower exhibit area shaded cave and on the upper viewing shaded window ledge (just walk up the stairs that also leads to Tiger Taiga to get the best vantage point for a snow leopard and an Amur tiger.)
 
During the heat of the summer, several areas in the exhibit provide shady areas with chilled rocks for the cats to enjoy. Under these select rocky areas, cooling units are housed that are checked daily. Several misters are also provided for the cats. Keepers monitor the cats throughout the day, especially in the summer. As with any new exhibit, enhancements are routine as animals acclimate, and in this case, will include an added shade cloth.
 
This adjoining early-childhood **education program space** connects young people to animals, habitats, cultures and group activities in a child-centered stimulating environment. Early learners will have the opportunity to participate in programs that enhance their observation, critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills, leading to a stronger desire and interest to learn and ultimately a better future for all.
 
Adult snow leopards can reach a length of 7 feet (2.1 metres) including the tail which is 3 feet long (0.9 metres). They stand around 2 feet tall at shoulder height and can weigh anywhere between 30-60kg, with males often being bigger than females.
 
Although they are the 5th largest cat species they the smallest of the 5 big cats. They are a small, stocky cat species with long fur fur and pale grey or green eyes. This long fur ranges in colour from white on the belly to pale grey across the rest of the body, with black spots on the head and neck and larger rosettes on the back. Despite the small stature the snow leopard has a long tail. Infact, snow leopards have the longest tail in proportion to body size of any cat species, it is nearly as long again as their body length.
 
The head of the snow leopard is domed with a short muzzle on the face and large nasal cavities.The muzzle is shorter than that of most cat species and has large wide nasal cavaties that warms the air before reaching its lungs. They also have short ears to reduce heat loss and thick dense fur to keep them warm.
 
Snow leopards are an obligate carnivore (meaning that their diet consists of at least 70% meat) and can hunt animals up to three times its own weight the common diet of the snow leopard consists of a range of species including: blue sheep, ibex, marmots, deer, pikas and other small mammals.
 
Most snow leopards live within cold rocky mountain landscapes. The long fur of this big cat allows it to withstand the low temperatures and the pattern of its fur helps it to blend in. Alongside this, they have short ears that reduce heat loss and short but strong front limbs and longer hind limbs that help them leap through the air. They have the longest tail, size for size of any cat species which can be used for aiding in balance on rocky ledges as well as like a rudder while they are jumping through the air. They even use their tail like a scarf to w
