thanks for that I been looking everywhere for the current xbox mappings for FS, I am not a gamer and dont use a xbox, but one suggestion I would have is change z scale to 20.00 that way 'pushing' the controllers will zoom in , and of course feathering slow down or speed up the moverments

hi all, I made a copy paste of all the values of the capture and I have a problem, when I press the joystick forward, the avatar walks backwards.and vice versa, why can it happen? It is the same when I fly or jump, what did I configure wrong? thank you.
 
This is great, thanks for sharing. FS really should come with a selection of defaults for popular controllers, I'd say the XBOX controller is probably the most common though so maybe in time they will include this.

thats great. I tried a xbox controller and got the settings about right but I just got to used to using the 3d mouse. I'm sure gamers will love the controller for a flycam I talked to another video maker and he uses a flight controller so you also use your feet for some of the flycam movement
 
Are you using an official Xbox controller? Or a generic version (recognized by your PC as "Generic/Gamepad"). I find this makes a huge difference. The Generic gamepads tend to be "wired" slightly different sometimes. The mappings I posted are specifically for official Xbox controllers.
 
Ty I will try its working perfectly now just not moving forward and back as id like Would it be the X axis for forward and back or the y I forget? I know z is up and down and thats working fine. Thanks for the help!
 
Ok maybe I'll stick with keyboard my brain hurts it this is so weird suddenly the axis is reversed again. Sorry I have zero clue as why it was fixed when i logged on then it broke again. Maybe a relog. Sharing my plight so anyone else does not feel alone LOL!
 
I have just upgraded my MP and now when I set all of the channel controls for my Joystick I hit save. If I close the joystick window and then open it again all of my settings are back at the default settings.
 
I am using Pixhawk Rover with latest build ( v3.0.1), MP latest build (1.3.41 build 1.1.6110.31287). I can connect the MP to the Pixhawk, telemetry is accurate and functions, I can ARM and DISARM through MP, I can open the Joystick settings window and change the settings, mapping the rudder and throttle, also mapping/setting the mode change buttons. As soon as I hit enable the output bars freeze and the joystick does not engage with the boat. Once I disable the Joystick the output bars become responsive to the Joystick.
 
Ok, I found one of my laptops with an older build of MP (1.3.39 BUILD 1.1.6038.12291) fired it up and connected to my boat (pixhawk, rover 3.0.1, over 3DR radios), all worked fantastically, my settings were saved and everything functioned as expected. When I hit enable, joystick becomes live and the boat responds - throttle, steering, mode settings etc.
 
Hi. I think Ive done both, actually. Is it important to save as new profile? I first thought the game was downloading old settings from the cloud, applying over the one Ive selected in the game (over and over).
 
Hi everyone,   
  
I have the CH Pro Pedals & CH Products Flight Sim Yoke for X-Plane 11.41r1 (build 114100 64-bit).  
  
Every time I do a joystick configuration/calibration, it never saves upon exit. I have tried to ensure the default X-Plane folder is set to read/write instead of read only to no avail. I've disconnected, restart and reconnected my USB ports to no avail. I've tried saving in different profiles and that doesn't work.  
  
Each time I go back, the settings are still red instead of blue which is frustrating because I cannot fly properly.   
  
Help please?
 
Hi everyone, 

I have the CH Pro Pedals & CH Products Flight Sim Yoke for X-Plane 11.41r1 (build 114100 64-bit).

Every time I do a joystick configuration/calibration, **it never saves upon exit.** I have tried to ensure the default X-Plane folder is set to read/write instead of read only to no avail. I've disconnected, restart and reconnected my USB ports to no avail. I've tried saving in different profiles and that doesn't work.

Each time I go back, the settings are still red instead of blue which is frustrating because I cannot fly properly.

Take a look at the before/after pictures. Immediately after exiting the calibration screen with everything in blue, it reverts to everything being in red after I go back into the calibration screen. This is also confirmed when I try to operate any aircraft.
 
Why are you going "Back" into the calibration screen? Once you calibrate your controls,and click "Finish" you are done. If you go back to the calibration screen and click on "Calibrate" they will be red again because it thinks you want to start over.
 
That sounds plausible. I used the default install? I also copied the joystick and keyboard files from xp11 into the new xp12 folder and I can select the but the settings do not change. After I do a calibration and save with a new name I can select the new name but cal is not like I saved it. Any ideas.
 
Anytime you copy config files from one version to another, you're inviting trouble. As you can see, it would have been easier just to re-map the axis and buttons from scratch. If that is the issue, you can fix it by erasing the content of your X-Plane **Output/preferences** folder. XP12 will create new default files the next time you open and close it, and you will have to recreate your joystick and keyboard profiles.
 
Otherwise, you can attach your XP**log.txt** file to your next post so that someone familiar with Windows OS can verify that you did not install it in a reserved folder path. I think that the desktop is the preferred and default install location, but every app is trying to get onto that prime real estate.
 
the first file is binary and labeled container.##, the second one is also labeled like a GUID and is either a plain XML file or a binary file. The XML files are controller settings and the binary files most likely are the other settings not saved in UserCfg.opt json file.
 
That being said, A3 does support control schemes for several controllers. But, I much prefer to set my own controls up, especially with Arma, because the game actually has the ability to set every button on my X52-Pro to doing something.
 
Anyway, if you do choose to use a scheme, go to Options > Controls > Controller tab, then select your X52 from the customizable controllers list. Once it's highlighted click customize, and then you can change the sensitivity and dead zones for your control axes. After doing that, click Unmap, (warning!) this will delete all the buttons you've set for the controller. Next click schemes and browse about for one that you want to try, then click Map.
 
After you've chosen a scheme, I would still highly recommend going through each of the control pages under keyboard controls (especially the ones for vehicle, helicopter, and plane) to familiarize yourself with the controls and change any that were mapped from the scheme that you don't like.
 
Not sure I understand: I bought an ordinary 'Thrustmaster T-FlightstickX' joystick early this year and simply plugged it into my PC and can fly planes and helis in AA3 just fine without any manual key adjustments of any kind.
 
Is there a way to transfer/share my saved joystick control settings in my current installation of xp11 to a second copy of xp11? Which file do I copy over and what is the process? I have copied over the Resources/joystick configs folder to my new copy of xp11 but that did not work. Or is this not possible to do and I must go through the process of binding all my control switches and button for each copy of x-plane 11? Please advise. Many thanks.
 
I'm replying to this re: Xplane 12. It looks like Simleybob1235 has in the YouTube video the addendum to the prf files you copy. Apart from "X-Plane Joystick Settings.prf", which you copy from Output\preferences, there are also prf files that are specific to the different aircraft. You'll find these in "Output\preferences\control profiles". Those files will need to be saved and copied over as well.
 
Yes quite right, i forgot to mention the folder. On my pc at least not on,y did the aircraft profiles work properly but so did the assignments for all my hardware. I think in that case its important to keep joysticks, pedals etc plugged in at all times, so they are in the same usb slots.
 
I want to calibrate the axes of my **new** Thrustmaster Airbus jostick in the FSUIPC. When I open the tab and push SET the following page opens and all values are already in. If I move the ailerons, elevator, rudder and thrust axes nothing happens e.g. all values are fixed. I previously used a different joystick and to me it seems that those values are from the old one and that the new joystick is not recognized by the FSUIPC at all. I also tried with uninstalingl FSUIP 7 and a new installation but no change.
 
You have to assign the axes before you can calibrate - did you do that? That is where your controllers axes are bound to the relevant functions.
And if you previously calibrated with a different controller, then the calibration page will show the previous calibration settings. Calibration settings are either general or bound to a profile, not to a controller.
 
I cleared all axes assignments in MSFS first. When I start to assign an axes in the FSUIPC and move the sidestick immediately the S-axes appears even that I did not touch the slider (throttle). There seems to be a problem with my Thrustmaster Airbus Pilot joystick settings even that I previously calibrated it in Windows 11. Any suggestions? Thanks.
