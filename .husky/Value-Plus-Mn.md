**Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance represents past performance; current returns may be lower or higher. Performance for institutional class shares prior to their initial offering is based on the performance of investor class shares. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. All returns reflect reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of taxes that an investor would pay on distributions or redemptions. Subject to certain exceptions, shares of a Fund redeemed or exchanged within 10 days of purchase are subject to a 2% redemption fee. Performance does not reflect this fee, which if deducted would reduce an individual's return.

Cependant, tout espoir qu'un voyage Wembley pourrait fournir la plate-forme idale pour que les Red Devils rebondissent a t rapidement refroidi alors que l'quipe bien entrane de Brighton de Roberto De Zerbi dominait la premire demi-heure.
 
Le gardien de Manchester United David de Gea (L) sauve du milieu de terrain de Brighton Kaoru MitomaAFPN'ayant got la dfaite qu'une seule fois lors de leurs neuf derniers matches toutes comptitions confondues, les Seagulls confiants ont continu sonder pour un match d'ouverture avec l'intervalle imminent. Cependant, malgr toute la possession de Brighton, c'est United qui est venu le plus prs de sortir de l'impasse avec Bruno Fernandes tirant une frappe basse juste ct du deuxime poteau.
 
C'est cependant Brighton qui a sembl la plus dangereuse des deux quipes dans le dernier tiers alors qu'Enciso a vu un entranement cinglant superbement contrecarr par De Gea, et Danny Welbeck a dirig une tte bout portant inutilement au-dessus de la barre.
 
Cela s'est poursuivi tout au long des phases finales alors que le concours progressait vers les prolongations, o Robert Sanchez est venu la rescousse de Brighton, plongeant avec brio pour contrecarrer une frappe dvie de Marcus Rashford .
 
La pause internationale de mars est sans doute arrive au mauvais moment pour Newcastle , qui avait commenc retrouver le genre de forme d'avant Nol qui avait initialement ouvert la possibilit d'une premire apparition en UEFA Champions League en 20 ans. Quoi qu'il en soit, ils ont pu poursuivre sur cette lance grce une impressionnante performance en premire mi-temps, et l'quipe d'Eddie Howe aurait bien pu prendre une avance mrite ds la 16e minute. Le ballon brch de Jacob Murphy dans la surface a t rencontr par Alexander Isak, qui a dirig sur la cible mais a vu son effort repouss par David de Gea, avant que l'effort de Joe Willock sur le rebond ne soit tir directement sur l'Espagnol.
 
Se nourrissant peut-tre de l'motion d'une foule qui avait vu Newcastle propuls un premier titre PL par les Red Devils trois reprises dans les annes 1990, la supriorit des Tynesiders s'est poursuivie aprs HT, et ce n'tait qu'une question de temps avant qu'ils ne prennent la tte. . Ils ont finalement fait exactement cela lorsque Bruno Guimares a envoy un ballon au poteau arrire, permettant Saint-Maximin de hocher la tte pour le Willock non marqu , qui est rentr la maison quelques mtres pour envoyer les fidles de Geordie dans le ravissement.
