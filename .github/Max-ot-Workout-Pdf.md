Max-OT is a relatively new type of training program developed by the company AST. The basic idea of Max-OT training is a twelve week program that will give someone the fastest results in terms of building muscle in the least amount of time as the company claims.
 
Because of the fact that Max-OT is all about overloading the muscles in the least amount of time, training 1-2 muscle groups is a must since it will increase efficiency. This also allows you to be in the 30-40 minute time zone in which intensity is maximized. Also this has positive psychological effects which leads to positive physical effects. When you know you only have to train 1-2 muscle groups in a workout, you focus more of your mental intensity towards that body part. Imagine if you had to work 3-4 body parts in a workout, you would probably be dreading the workout. Focusing intensely on 1-2 body parts leads you to train harder for those body parts therefore accelerating progress.

The rep range as the makers of this program boast will allow maximum muscle overload and will recruit the most muscle fibers leading to increased strength and size. Also intensity is affected by this since you only need to focus on 4-6 repetitions rather than 8-12 which a lot of bodybuilders do. Because rep ranges are shorter all your mental energy is set on doing just 4-6 repetitions and therefore psychological intensity is maximized allowing you to achieve better muscle overload.
 
Resting for 2-3 minutes makes sure your muscles can recover its intra-cellular energy and take out lactic acid which is anti anabolic. Another thing the makers of this program point out is that you have to feel recovered to do another set. If you feel like crap then you might not be able to perform to max intensity and therefore achieve muscle overload.
 
For muscular overload you must keep increasing the weight. You should always try increasing the weight and doing more repetitions in the 4-6 rep range. Remember you will be getting stronger each time so you have to always force your muscles to work harder.
 
This program is geared towards building the most amount of muscle in the least time. One of the things that the makers repeat and emphasize is muscular overload rather than fatigue. Since muscular fatigue is more like training for endurance and builds up lactic acid, it is not as efficient in building muscle. Rather muscular overload ensures that the muscle is overstressed not burned out. Because the muscle is overstressed it rapidly tries to adapt to the changes by building more strength and size.
 
Lifters who are looking to add some serious strength will also benefit from a Max-OT workout. First of all low rep ranges stimulate the fast twitch fibers since large amounts of stress are induced for a short period of time, and since this best suits the fast twitch fibers, your body recruits them. Fast twitch fibers produce the most contractile force and therefore when they are stimulated, you will get stronger. Secondly the program stresses intensity and muscular overload. These two principles work in together to increase strength since the muscle is worked so hard and has to rapidly adapt to the stress by becoming much stronger.
 
If done properly progress will be very good. In terms of strength and size the results will be great because of the new principles that Max-OT brings to the table such as muscular overload, maximum mental and physical intensity, resting periods, taking advantage of hormonal levels, and using a repetition range that maximizes muscle fiber recruitment. All these well thought out ideas will produce great gains.

Welcome to the AST Sports Science 12 week Max-OT On-Line Training Course. We are about to embark on a 12-week journey that will change the way you approach building muscle forever. The goal here is to teach you the principles and techniques involved in Max-OT training. Learning these techniques and how to apply them will give you the most efficient tools for building the maximum amount of muscle in the shortest amount of time.
 
Not only will I cover training methods extensively, but I will also unravel the mental aspect of building muscle. I will dissect the psychological roadblocks that are responsible for derailing most people who train from ultimately reaching their goals and show you how the very structure of Max-OT eliminates these obstacles. We will get rid of bad habits and condition ourselves for efficiency, making everything we do a means to an end.
 
With this hierarchy understood, it will allow you to establish the best foundation for learning and practicing Max-OT principles and techniques that I guarantee will allow you to build muscle and strength at a rate and to an extent you never knew possible.
 
Training one major muscle group per workout is paramount to the Max-OT principles as it optimizes key physiological and psychological high-points designed to extract the greatest effect from your training. Every time you train the Max-OT way, you leave the gym fully confident that you performed a workout that will result in muscle growth.
 
Contrary to what most have been led to believe, forced reps are counterproductive to building muscle. They artificially fatigue the muscle, deplete muscle energy stores, and produce non-progressive overload just to name a few.
 
Once you understand that lifting with a heavy amount of weight is the most potent stimulus for muscle growth, you will continue to strive for greater overload. You will continue to get bigger and stronger in less time.
 
If a muscle is not allowed to fully recover between workouts, muscle growth will be impeded, over-training will occur, and muscle breakdown will be inevitable. You will become stagnated. Muscle mass and strength will more than likely decrease. Energy levels will dwindle, appetite will lessen, and motivation will disappear.
 
As you can see, recovery between workouts is absolutely critical for muscle growth success as well as for optimal health and well-being. This is why a major component of Max-OT training is to optimize recovery between workouts.
 
Allowing **5 to 6 full days** between the training of the same muscle group is essential for full and complete recuperation. Recuperating fully leads to maximum muscle growth. Incomplete recuperation leads to muscle and strength breakdown.
 
As I said earlier, most training programs have you training far too much. The days of training the same muscle group on Thursday that you trained on Monday are long gone. Max-OT takes the elements of **intensity** and **overload** and maximizes the recovery the implementation of these two growth-promoting elements requires.
 
Every part of Max-OT is designed to potentiate and synergistically work with the program as a whole. The longer recovery time is necessary to allow for full recovery from the **higher than normal muscle fiber recruitment and stimulation**that Max-OT generates. Max-OT style training places much greater demands on muscle recovery. Greater muscle fiber stimulation and maximum recovery generate maximum muscle growth and strength increases. This is what Max-OT is all about.
 
Also, you should consume plenty of lean protein during this CR as well. When you take a week off from training, you still need to eat and supplement properly for growth to occur. In fact, is vitally important during this phase.
 
On bicep movements, you want to lower the weight twice as slow as you raise the weight. In other words, the resistance portion of the movement should be twice as slow as the contraction portion. The same applies to the triceps. The resistance portion of the movement should be twice as slow as the contraction portion. The overall pace on both should be moderate and the contraction portion should be explosive and forceful.
 
The purpose of this course is to give you a full and complete understanding of the inner and outer workings of Max-OT: to provide you with real-world information that you can use immediately to accelerate your training results. I will break down every aspect of Max-OT in vivid detail. My goal when this course is finished is to have 500,000 Max-OT experts and 5,000,000 extra solid pounds of muscle in the gyms around the world.

**Max OT is Not for Beginners.** Yes, Max OT is marketed to beginners. And many trainees who used it as their first routine saw "great gains." However, Max OT is not appropriate for pure beginners for the following reasons:
 adinserter Ad Block 4
 
True intermediate and advanced weight trainees already have the base strength and proper exercise technique needed for going to failure on all sets, which is required for this program. Also, they have developed their bodies to the point that doing more "direct work" (e.g., arms, calves, forearms) is actually beneficial.
 
**How Can It Benefit You?** If you are one of the prime candidates for Max OT, then you can expect to see impressive results. Most people experience a fairly even split of size and strength gains; of course, much of it depends on your diet.
 
I did Max OT after about 2 years of training. I had previous success with several full body or upper/lower body split routines. I had also tried many different body part splits, but always experienced poor results.
 
**If I Could Do It Over Again.** The rest of this review includes what I have learned about the program that I wish I had known when doing it. I hope you can use this knowledge to increase your potential by knowing it beforehand.
