I've started a local instance of overleaf/sharelatex and I'm trying to add a template class to the data directory so I can use it to compile a paper I'm working on, but I can't find the place to unzip the cls files into.
 
However, the above command only works when the tex distribution (2023 in this case) matches the one in the repo tlmgr is looking in (2024). This meant that I had to find and run update-tlmgr-latest.sh first, from this documentation page.
