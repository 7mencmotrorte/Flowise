In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, Congress eliminated this requirement and DoD is no longer exploring program implementation in this area. However, we believe the research and identification of outstanding questions are valuable and should be shared with the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) stakeholder community. Much of the supporting research may hold value for any future deliberations on the merits of remote electronic voting.

FVAP Final Report on the Electronic Voting Demonstration Project
This report explains the context of the research associated with the electronic voting demonstration project, and discusses the scope and purpose of the research, its limitations, conclusions and recommendations.
 
The FVAP Statement on Research Reports Related to UOCAVA System Testing explains the context of the research as it relates to FVAP's previously mandated electronic voting demonstration project. It discusses the scope and purpose of the research, its limitations, conclusions and recommendations.
 
This compiled document (15 MB) includes the "Voting System Testing Laboratory (VSTL) Functionality and Security and Testing" and "Penetration (PEN) Test of a Simulated Election" reports and all accompanying appendices. Due to its large file size, the individual reports and appendices are provided below.
 
This report describes a 2010 research effort to help inform FVAP's previously mandated electronic voting demonstration project. The VSTL testing was conducted to gauge the sufficiency of the Election Assistance Commission's Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act Pilot Program Testing Requirements and evaluate the quality of testing across VSTLs.

This report describes a 2011 research effort to help inform FVAP's previously mandated electronic voting demonstration project. It describes penetration testing of three voting systems. It is important to note the tests were only intended to serve as a proof-of-concept for the establishment of a model design and methodology for future penetration testing.
 
On February 10, 2021, the EAC's Commissioners unanimously adopted the newest VVSG standard, version 2.0. In November and December of 2022, the VVSG 2.0 was fully ready to be used for testing with the accreditation of both Voting System Test Labs (VSTL) by the EAC to test to this new standard.
 
As described in section 3 of the EAC's VVSG Lifecycle Policy, the EAC no longer accepts submissions to test new voting systems to previous major versions 12 months after new major VVSG standards are ready to be used for testing. With the accreditation of the first VSTL to test to VVSG 2.0 on November 15, 2022, VVSG 1.0 and VVSG 1.1 are now no longer used by the EAC to certify voting systems as of November 16, 2023.
 
Prior to the passage of HAVA, voting systems were assessed and qualified by the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), a nonpartisan association consisting of state level election directors nationwide. These voting systems were tested against the 1990 and 2002 voting system standards developed by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). With HAVA's enactment, the responsibility for developing voting system standards was transferred from the FEC to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and their new iterations are now the EAC Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.
 
The EAC VVSG Lifecycle Policy facilitates migration to new VVSG standards by providing guidance on the types of version changes, Voting System Test Laboratory (VSTL) accreditation, VVSG migration of prior major standards, and establishing a periodic review timeline for new standards going forward. The policy defines changes that may be made to systems certified to prior standards and describes the process for updating the standards as defined in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA).
 
The EAC Testing and Certification Program Director provides an annual report to the Executive Director at the end of each fiscal year detailing recommendations for updates to the VVSG that have been collected throughout the prior fiscal year from various stakeholders. Feedback from this process will inform the decision to make updates to the VVSG. This process is detailed in the VVSG Lifecycle Policy.
 
At the September 2016 TGDC Meeting, the Committee, through the Project Charter, adopted the name VVSG 2.0 for the next iteration of guidelines. Also, the Project Charter laid out the proposed structure of the document, as well as a proposed timeline. At the February 2017 TGDC Meeting, the scope of the document was unanimously decided and a draft of the guidelines was presented.
 
This document provides a project report on an online voting system created by Nitin Bhasin for NIIT. The report includes an introduction to the online voting system, background and significance of the study, objectives, justification, scope, requirements, and database design. It aims to address issues with existing voting methods in India by providing a secure online system for citizens to vote from anywhere using just a voter ID and password.Read less
 
The Voting Systems Assessments Project, also known as Voting Solutions All People, (VSAP) is a civic innovation to modernise the electoral services, specifically the InkaVote Plus voting system in Los Angeles County. The current voting system is outdated, having first being introduced five decades ago, so the (VSAP) provided a framework for the need to ensure that the integrity of elections is protected while maximising accessibility and openness to public participation (2).
 
The Voting Systems Assessments Project started on 16th September 2009 and is a decade-long initiative to improving the voting system in Los Angeles County (8). The project is opening up the voting processes and the system through innovations in civic technology (1). The initiative was introduced because of the need to replace the current outdated LA County voting system (InkaVote Plus) which was first introduced in the 1960s. The system is no longer fit for purpose because LA has now over 5 million voters and the significant demographic changes that have taken place during that time have meant there are 10 different languages spoken amongst the population. The current system also is limited because it only allows a maximum 312 vote positions over 12 pages preventing longer ballots for more positions or propositions.
 
The project was supported and endorsed by the Voting Technology Project, which is a project run by both The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and James Irvine Foundation and this helped to secure a grant of $150,000 towards the required research for the project (8).
 
Firstly, YouGov/Polimetrix conducted a countywide voter survey from March 16th to March 28th, 2010 containing 500 random sampled voters who then undertook the online survey. Alongside this America Inc. collected a sample of 651 voters then asked them to complete phone surveys between March 11th and March 29th. The telephone surveys also had additional language features to ensure the Mandarin and Spanish speaking population were able to participate in the surveys (8).
 
Thirdly, there was a poll worker survey conducted online by 1,100 poll workers between April 29 and June 8, 2010. The aim of the survey was to ask the polling staff what their thoughts and opinions were of the voting process and system used in Los Angeles County (8).
 
Fourthly, local election officials comprising of 26 City Clerks were asked to take part in focus groups which were conducted between May 7th and May 11th, 2010. The clerks were asked for their feedback on the current system used in LA and their thoughts on voting systems (8)
 
The various methodologies asked respondents about four types of voting systems in relation to marking and counting ballots in LA County. These were: Optical Scanning, DREs, hand-counted paper and the current InkaVote Plus. Voters were additionally asked to state what values and priorities they want a new voting system to enact.
 
The project is divided into five phases, with phase four currently in progress and scheduled to end in December 2019 (9). Phase one of the project aimed to gather public opinion on the current voting system and what qualities voters valued in a new system. This involved extensive research using surveys of the general population and gathered extensive quantitative data and gauged public opinion on; the current voting system in LA County, the values and priorities needed in voting systems and a range of options available to replace the existing voting system. This was done alongside 12 focus groups, this method gained valuable qualitative data on public opinion on the matter but additionally, the focus groups sought to speak with voters from marginal groups such as those with disabilities, young voters and ethnic minorities who have lower turnout (8). Phase two involved the stakeholders and committee members analysing the research undertaken during the first phase and sort this into priorities and values that the new system should undertake known as the General Voting System Principles (GVSP).
 
The results from the surveys showed some polarization and the emergence some apparent cleavages between different demographic groups in relation to what they wanted from the new system. Though there was some consensus on issues such as voters generally ranked accuracy of counting ballots as the most important feature in a voting system with security ranking second place (8).
