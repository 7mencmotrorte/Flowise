Chances are you've seen an ad or two about affiliate marketing. Some guy on YouTube showing off his expensive car and telling you how you can get rich (quick?) if you sign up for his free course on affiliate marketing.
 
Now, to be sure, there are plenty of people who make good money selling other people's products for a slice of the pie. But, like anything else, it's hard work to make a full-time income out of it. That said, **many** **indie authors** **and book lovers are in a unique position to make some extra money through an ebook affiliate program.** How much extra money depends on the work you put into it.

As hinted at above, an affiliate marketing program is one in which you get paid for promoting and selling other people's products. And in this case, we're talking about ebooks and certain ebook accessories.
 
Essentially, all you need to do is sign up for one (or more), generate your affiliate links for products you want to sell, and then get to work putting the word out. But the how of getting the word out is the hard part.
 
As an affiliate marketer, you only make money when someone buys something through your affiliate links. So getting people to click on those links and purchase is the hard part. **And in order to make good money, you'll need to have lots of traffic.** For this, you'll need a website with content. For most, this means a book blog.
 
If you're an author, you probably already have a website on which you showcase your own books (and if you don't, you should!). If you're simply an avid reader, you'll need to invest in a website, which can be done on the cheap. Then, you'll need to**write regular blog posts (book reviews or other content)** in which you mention the books/products you're selling and entice people to buy them.
 
How you get this traffic is beyond the scope of this article. Indeed, there have been many affiliate marketing books written on the subject, not to mention a bunch of courses advertised on YouTube and Facebook, and everywhere else on the internet.
 
You may be familiar with the Smashwords independent bookstore already, even if you didn't know they have an affiliate marketing program. They hit the news in the publishing world in 2022 when they were acquired by Draft2Digital.
 
But, authors and publishers can choose to raise their affiliate commissions to encourage aggressive promotion. This means you can earn up to 80.5% in commissions for certain books. The one major drawback is the 48-hour cookie window. **If a book shopper clicks on your affiliate link but doesn't buy anything for 49 hours, you won't get any money from that sale because it's outside the 48-hour window.**

I'm sure you don't need me to tell you about the Apple company as a whole. Apple TV has been coming on strong recently with a wide variety of celebrated shows, but they're also expanding their ebook and audiobook markets. As they strive to compete with Amazon in this realm, there will be opportunities for affiliates to join their program.
 
The Apple affiliate program, called the Performance Partner Program, isn't open to just anyone. You have to be approved before you can start earning commissions. **But if you are approved, Apple will provide you with a host of resources to get the job done.** Icons, badges, and banner ads are just a few things they provide to help you make the most of their program. They also provide a detailed reporting system to help you optimize your campaigns.
 
You earn a standard 7% on books in the Apple Books store within a 30-day cookie window. Plus, you can promote other subscriptions and services to earn more money. If you're serious about making a go of this affiliate marketing thing, Apple would be a good company to get in with.
 
Ebooks.com is a website dedicated to providing all kinds of books at affordable prices to people worldwide. They currently have nearly 6 million members and over 2 million ebooks. Launched in 2000, this is one of the oldest internet booksellers out there.
 
The affiliates who join their program are usually book bloggers or authors with books for sale on the site. They sell books on a variety of topics, including both fiction and nonfiction. **They provide detailed tracking and access to their API so you can make the most out of your partnership.**
 
Their commission rate is generous, and they have one of the longest cookie windows on this list at 45 days. And with an estimated 20,000 new books a month, you're sure to find books you love to tell your audience about to generate affiliate revenue.
 
Most affiliate commissions are 2% but they can be as high as 5% on select products at select times. You don't have to stick with just ebooks if you sign up for Barnes & Noble's affiliate marketing program. **You can also earn money on physical books, DVDs, Blu-rays, games, and other gift items.**
 
This program is run by CJ Affiliate, a well-known affiliate marketing company. They offer incentives and resources to help you succeed, but the extremely short 1-day cookie window is a major downside for this program.
 
The Kobo affiliate program is in the hands of Rakuten, which has been in the affiliate marketing world for over 25 years. **They provide a range of analytical and personal help to their affiliate partners, which is not the case with every program out there**.
 
AbeBooks, formerly known as Advanced Book Exchange, has a pretty solid affiliate program you may want to consider. Not only do they have a great selection of ebooks on their website, but they also sell physical books, as well. So if you prefer the feel of a physical book in your hand, you may want to consider this affiliate network.
 
**You can find a serious collection of rare, out-of-print, and collectible books on this website.** Sellers from all around the world put their books up for sale, along with collectibles and works of art. Of course, they also offer new and used books of all kinds.
 
And if you aren't sure you want to deal with a marketplace for independent booksellers around the world, you can rest easy knowing that Amazon owns AbeBooks. They aren't going anywhere anytime soon. The one catch to be aware of here is the $500 item limit. You only get paid a commission on an individual product up to $500. So if you sell a book that's worth $600, you only earn 5% of $500. But if you sell two books at $497 each, you get the full 5% on each of those books.
 
The program is easy to join, allowing you to choose between banner or text links for your website. Like Barnes & Noble, their program is operated by CJ Affiliate, so you'll need to start an account with them.
 
Books-A-Million provides book affiliate resources to help you become a successful affiliate marketer. **These resources include marketing tips, linking instructions, and personalized help.**
 
With an Amazon Associate account, you can make money online by selling things like Amazon Kindle devices on your book-related website. They also offer bounty fees for things like Kindle Unlimited subscriptions that you generate through your website, social media, or email marketing efforts. **They don't provide commissions for ebooks sales, but as the biggest online bookseller, we would be remiss to ignore this affiliate program.**
 
Ebook Maestro doesn't actually sell any ebooks.**Instead, they sell software that can help authors create ebooks with interactive elements such as videos, audio, and Flash, among others.** They can also compile a number of other digital items, such as guides, magazines, and tests. Their affiliate marketing program offers up to 40% commissions on their software.
 
If you're not an author and don't have a website yet, you probably should think twice about going into ebook affiliate programs thinking you'll be buying a Ducati next year. But if you love books and you like to write reviews, then throwing a few affiliate links or banners on your website could net you some extra grocery money!
 
According to Pew Research Center, one in three Americans read at least one e-book in 2021, up from just one in six in 2011. Some 33% of US bookworms read e-books and print books, while 9% have ditched physical books in favor of digital products.
 
Convinced? Sign up for the AbeBooks affiliate program through Impact Radius. The program has a 30-day cookie window and pays a standard 5% commission on sales of books priced up to $500. In other words, if a customer clicks your affiliate link and buys a $700 book, you only get paid the first $500.
 
AbeBooks occasionally offers commissionable coupons to affiliate marketers, earning them money from resulting sales. It provides various affiliate marketing resources, including banner ads, text links, and API access to the AbeBooks website. The company also has a dedicated affiliate management team to answer your questions.
 
The site offers various other services. These include an audiobook publishing solution that pays creators 75% royalty rates and a cover design and book-binding service for independent authors and small publishers. BookBaby offers free US ground shipping on all printed book orders of 25+ units.
 
Apple Books has a 60 to 90-day cycle on commission payments and has a minimum threshold of $30. Commissions can be paid in 60 global currencies across 214 countries, with conversions handled through American Express (minus any applicable fees).
 
Barnes & Noble offers various resources to help affiliates drive traffic and sales, including a dedicated affiliate manager, a robust product catalog, and regular seasonal and holiday-related promotions.
 
The online store stocks every type of eBook, from current bestsellers to beloved classics. It also sells award-winning e-readers that allow users to store thousands of e-books. Kobo e-readers include a built-in light for easier
