Participants:  Two samples of AOA member orthopaedic surgeons: 81 randomly selected from a list of AOA members with publicly available contact details (AOA random sample); and a sample obtained by searching with Google for "orthopaedic surgeon" and the name of the major city in each of the eight Australian states and territories in turn; the top eight results for each search were considered for inclusion (AOA Google sample).
 
Main outcome measures:  Non-compliance of advertising material, by surgeon sample, with the AHPRA and AOA guidelines; associations between non-compliance and sample, state, location (metropolitan, regional), and subspecialty.
 
The Australian Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons (ASOS) is an association of practising orthopaedic surgeons across all specialties. ASOS is completely independent and funded by member subscriptions. ASOS does not accept money from governments or health funds. We speak with an independent voice for hard working orthopaedic surgeons who make an outstanding contribution to the lives of many Australians.
 
ASOS supports the importance of the doctor-patient relationship and the right of patients to receive the best possible orthopaedic treatment. ASOS does not support US style managed care, a system where health corporations seek to influence treatment to meet corporate financial objectives.
 
ASOS has just today received the new SIRA guidelines for the administration of compensable patients (WorkCover and MAA). ASOS is working through them to ensure that there are no adverse consequences flowing from these changes. ASOS requested a number of [...]

The internet can be a double-edged sword for patients seeking health information, particularly in terms of direct-to-consumer advertising. In a paper recently published in The Medical Journal of Australia, researchers at UNSW Sydney revealed a considerable proportion of orthopaedic surgeons who are members of the Australian Orthopaedic Association (AOA) did not comply with AOA and Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) advertising guidelines.
 
Orthopaedic surgeons specialise in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal injuries and diseases. This includes problems relating to bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons. The surgeries they perform range from elective procedures such as joint replacement surgery to emergency surgery on patients with musculoskeletal injuries.
 
In the AOA random sample, most of the non-compliance was due to misleading or deceptive advertising, arousing unreasonable expectations of benefit, using testimonials, and making claims of superior performance. Reasons for non-compliance among the AOA Google sample were similar, with a high proportion also non-compliant due to referencing specific brand names on their websites and failing to declare if a commercial relationship exists with these brands.
 
The researchers note previous studies conducted overseas demonstrated poor quality advertising material on orthopaedic surgeon websites, with websites containing exaggerated and subjective information with no scientific references.
 
The methods used in the study were designed to gain a representative sample of advertising material patients may encounter when accessing information about orthopaedic surgeons. The AOA random sample was taken from 500 AOA members who elected to make their details publicly available. The sample size calculation estimated that a sample of 81 surgeons would be required to gain a 95% confidence level of +10 percentage points.

It is generally accepted that all arthroplasty patients should receive venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding risk assessments, and that postoperative thromboprophylaxis be routinely prescribed where appropriate. Guideline recommendations regarding what to prescribe, however, have been inconsistent over the years, particularly regarding the appropriateness of aspirin. Our aim was to explore thromboprophylaxis patterns in use following hip and knee arthroplasty in Australia, and to examine associated variables.
 
VTE prevention post-arthroplasty is an evolving and multi-faceted entity, influenced by a range of factors and seemingly in need of robust evidence from large clinical trials to guide practice. The data highlighted potential short-falls in practice related to aspirin over-use, which could be further explored and addressed in future studies in order to optimise patient outcomes and reduce the significant morbidity and healthcare costs associated with VTE following these increasingly common surgical procedures.
 
Hip and knee arthroplasties are increasing worldwide. In Australia [1, 2] and the United Kingdom (UK) [3], annual procedure numbers almost doubled and more than tripled between 2003 and 2016, respectively. Although comparable data is limited, similar trends have also been described in the United States of America (USA) [4, 5]. These trends have potentially significant repercussions given that both procedures are considered risk factors for a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, namely venous thromboembolism (VTE) [6].
 
We previously reported on a survey of Australian hip and knee surgeons examining thromboprophylaxis preferences, conducted in 2010 [16]. Given the varying and changing local and international recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis post-arthroplasty, we have conducted two follow-up surveys, 5 years apart (in 2012 and 2017) to explore changes in the thromboprophylaxis patterns in use in Australia.
 
The study was designed as a cross-sectional exploratory study, employing quantitative surveys conducted 5 years apart to meet its aims. The two surveys were conducted separately, each receiving ethics approval from the Tasmanian Social Science Human Research Ethics Committee.
 
An address list of Australian hip and knee surgeons was compiled by searching practice listings, hospital websites, and the internet. Invitations to participate were mailed to 478 surgeons in May 2012, with reminders sent two and 4 weeks later. Surgeons could complete an enclosed hard-copy or access the survey online; most participants completed hard-copies (95.9%).
 
The final response rates were 50.0 and 65.8%, respectively (Table 1). Compared to Study 1, respondents in Study 2 conducted less arthroplasties, were less likely to be members of the Arthroplasty Society of Australia (ASA), and were less likely to conduct their clinical practice in the private sector.
 
Of note, at the time of writing, the evidence for aspirin-only protocols in hip arthroplasty patients specifically was limited, and they are not recommended in the recent NICE guideline [14, 18]. Nevertheless, almost one in three hip surgeons in our Study 2 cohort reported using aspirin-only routines in hip arthroplasty patients, either by employing a blanket approach or as part of a risk-stratification protocol. Furthermore, approximately one third of both hip and knee surgeons in Study 2 who said they preferred risk-stratification protocols did not consider active cancer or a personal history of VTE as factors that would classify their patient as being at high risk of VTE, and thus unsuitable for aspirin-only treatment. Together, these practices may be unnecessarily exposing patients to the risk of VTE and its associated treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation. Further, well-designed research investigating the efficacy and safety of aspirin-only routines in hip arthroplasty patients is needed to explore this more thoroughly.
 
A factor related to guideline use in Study 2 was guideline familiarity; surgeons were more likely to report using a guideline if they reported being familiar with it, suggesting that familiarity positively impacts uptake (although the reverse may also be true). It should be noted, however, that many surgeons who reported being *very familiar* with a guideline still did not report using it (72.9 to 93.9%, varying by guideline). Furthermore, our findings suggest that in comparison to the combined effects of research literature, experience and patient complications (listed by 52.9% of surgeons as having influenced their protocol), guidelines and local protocols appear to exert a quantitatively smaller influence (only listed by 16.2% of surgeons). Of all the guidelines reportedly used by surgeons, the orthopaedic-specific ASA and AAOS guidelines were the most popular. Compared to other guidelines, these both include pharmacological *and* non-pharmacological aspects of VTE prevention (over and above mechanical prophylaxis recommendations) in their main body of recommendations.
 
Our findings suggest that VTE prevention following hip and knee arthroplasty is an evolving and multi-faceted entity in Australia, with many different influencing factors and potentially some evidence-practice gaps that need further exploring. It will be interesting to ob
