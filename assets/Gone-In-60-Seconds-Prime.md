I Have a Sharp Roku TV model # LC-43LB371U Manufactured April, 2015. I have had the same problem with Amazon Prime video icons being blank when I open the app. This has happened several times over the past year or so. I followed the suggestion to do a system restart on the TV and it worked. Sometimes restarting my Xfinity cable box has helped but not always. This time I went to the Home icon on my Roku remote then: **SETTINGS -> SYSTEM -> POWER -> SYSTEM RESTART.** When opening the Amazon Prime App, it took a few seconds but the icons came back.

I had this problem with my Amazon Prime app and I fixed it. Thankfully, another post mentioned that the older Roku devices - whether the box or the RokuTV - had limited memory for today's apps. That got me thinking.

I then removed 11 of the 19 installed apps - each of which of course takes up memory by being on the device. I then pulled out the power cord and allowed a bit for the electronics within to lose charge and voltage.
 
The issue is that the older Roku devices - standalone or TV - did not have enough memory within them to support the downloaded code within them getting larger. The code getting larger comes from two sources: as suppliers update their code from time-to-time they inevitably make the size of the code grow - and - as time goes on you add more access apps to your Roku to get more channels.
 
Both of these use more memory. When memory gets insufficient, the actual operation code of the device is protected so that it at least continues to work. Sacrificed is the nice pictures in the thumbnails.
 
The Solution. You cannot do anything about the bloat occurring in the apps, only the channel software providers can do that. But you can delete all those loaded apps that you don't really use or want. When I started the process, I had 23 apps loaded. I deleted entirely 12 of those, leaving the "essential" 11. Reset.
 
I only have a bare minimum of apps, maybe 10 so I don't think that's it. I still think it's a bug that needs to be fixed. Also this TV is only a few years old (4k/HDR) it's not an old ROKU device at all. I've tried everything from turning off fast-startup, removed as many apps as possible. It's been occurring for a while.. It's not consistent, but when I normally lose the icons is when I exit antenna viewing. When it happens, if I launch another app like YoutubeTV or Tablo the icons return when exiting those apps.
 

One joy of working so closely with our loyal customers is being able to hear their needs and offer a solution. Our Motorized Sprayer was created for customers that approached us regarding issues with carpal tunnel, arthritis and other physical limitations that made it hard for them to repeatedly squeeze a trigger sprayer or pump the tank sprayer. The Motorized Sprayer is a tool that offers a strong stream without the physical demand.
 
**Where can I find the motorized sprayer?** 
Our motorized sprayers are available nationwide, check out our Store Locator and Online Retailers to find all of our 30 SECONDS products.

**
Does it use the same product as your original Outdoor Cleaner?**
 
**How much surface area will it cover?** 
The motorized sprayer comes with 1.3 gallons of ready-to-use Outdoor Cleaner. However, coverage varies depending on the porosity of the surface. In general, though, the power sprayer will cover up to 400 square feet. If you have a larger project, consider getting our concentrate. Click here for retailers.
 
Give the cord a firm pinch on both sides of the lid to remove a possible kink. While this is designed to be a "kinkless" hose, issues can occasionally occur with shipping and storage. The main areas to check for kinks are where the hose attaches to the sprayer, or where the hose attaches to the cap.
 
If all else has failed, a little patience might be needed. You may notice an initial squirt of liquid and then nothing. The Motorized Sprayers is tested to make sure it works; that's where the initial bit of water comes from. From there, it can take 45 seconds to prime. Make sure you hold down the sprayer handle uninteruppted for 45 seconds. This helps the pump move the product through the hose completely. Once product starts pumping through, the sprayer should work continuously for at least the amount of time needed to apply all 1.3 gallons.
 
At 30 SECONDS, we know how great our products work. But don't just take our word for it. Check out this review and photo from a satisfied Amazon customer:

"This is fantastic stuff. We had mold on the bricks on the south side of our house. We tried using the power sprayer to remove it and it didn't even lighten the mold a bit. We tried a combination of Dawn and a scrub brush, along with the power sprayer, with absolutely no result so I went searching for a solution. While standing in the hardware store, I read the reviews on the available products and decided to give 30 Seconds a try. We bought the ready to use formula with the motorized power sprayer. The first sprayer didn't work and I have to admit, I considered getting my money back and starting with something else. I am so glad that I exchanged it instead. 

"We did a small test area and, per the instructions, kept it wet for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, there was a visible improvement so we set off applying the 30 Seconds spray to the rest of the moldy bricks. After keeping it wet for 15 minutes, the bricks looked so much better than they have in years. We rinsed per the instructions and the results speak for themselves. One of the main reasons we chose this cleaner was that it was safe for plants and as you can see, we just finished planting some little bushes right in front of the area to be cleaned.
 
Longitude is the measurement east or west of the prime meridian. Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians. Each meridian measures one arc degree of longitude. The distance around Earth measures 360 degrees.  
  
The meridian that runs through Greenwich, England, is internationally accepted as the line of 0 degrees longitude, or prime meridian. The antimeridian is halfway around the world, at 180 degrees. It is the basis for the International Date Line.  
  
Half of the world, the Eastern Hemisphere, is measured in degrees east of the prime meridian. The other half, the Western Hemisphere, in degrees west of the prime meridian.  
  
Degrees of longitude are divided into 60 minutes. Each minute of longitude can be further divided into 60 seconds. For example, the longitude of Paris, France, is 2 29' E (2 degrees, 29 minutes east). The longitude for Brasilia, Brazil, is 47 55' W (47 degrees, 55 minutes west).  
  
A degree of longitude is about 111 kilometers (69 miles) at its widest. The widest areas of longitude are near the Equator, where Earth bulges out. Because of Earth's curvature, the actual distance of a degrees, minutes, and seconds of longitude depends on its distance from the Equator. The greater the distance, the shorter the length between meridians. All meridians meet at the North and South Poles.  
  
Longitude is related to latitude, the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. Lines of latitude are called parallels. Maps are often marked with parallels and meridians, creating a grid. The point in the grid where parallels and meridians intersect is called a coordinate. Coordinates can be used to locate any point on Earth.  
  
Knowing the exact coordinates of a site (degrees, minutes, and seconds of longitude and latitude) is valuable for military, engineering, and rescue operations. Coordinates can give military leaders the location of weapons or enemy troops. Coordinates help engineers plan the best spot for a building, bridge, well, or other structure. Coordinates help airplane pilots land planes or drop aid packages in specific locations.
 
**Into the Great Wide Open**  
It was not until the 18th century that people were able to correctly determine their longitude, even though they had been able to figure out latitude for some time. Not being able to reckon longitude was dangerous for sailors. Without an exact location, they could easily run out of food or water on a long expedition into uncharted territory.
