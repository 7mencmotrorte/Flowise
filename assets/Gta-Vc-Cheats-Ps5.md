His **Leveling the Playing Field Act** led to key wins for Ohio companies. This new, bipartisan legislation would allow private companies to sue foreign producers that harm American companies. By allowing private companies harmed by trade cheats to use their own resources to fight back, the bill would help address customs fraud and protect American workers and American jobs.
 
Hello, I just bought this game today and finished installing. I was playing the game, and remembered a few cheats I used to use in the past. Most of them rely on a command code called TestingCheatsEnabled. In order to use it, you're supposed to hold ctrl+shift+C and type the command testingcheatsenabled true. This is supposed to turn on testing cheats such as addRP and addQP, as well as reset bugged objects. However,**the system is not recognizing the command code**. I looked it up on the web, and so far all of the suggested fixes **require a minor edit to the Commands.ini folder**- changing the**0 to a 1**. The guide instructs to **save the file under All Files**, and **not to save it as a Text file.** After carefully following each of these steps, this cheat is still not working. I'm very disappointed and frustrated. Help, please? For me, the play experience is so much better with access to this command code, and the cheats it unlocks. (I don't play for achievements because of it but oh well lol) **Is there a workaround for this issue**, or am I unable to play the **purchased version** of this game using this particular command code?

@DeadMenDL , some of the cheat codes were added to the game to allow the devs to test certain situations. Quite often, if certain cheats are enabled it can corrupt your saved games rendering them unplayable. Sims Medieval, while sharing a similar game architecture to Sims 3, is a game that is limited in scope so the Devs may have disabled or not included these cheats to be easily available in game. If you found a way to enable them, use them at your own risk. I would advise not using them.
 
I am having this problem, but I know I did have access to the cheats at one time because several of my previous save games have the clothing filters off. When I opened the Commands.ini, it was already set to 1. I've tried changing it to 0, restarting the comp, changing it back to 1, but nothing will let me unlock the outfits on my new saves. Does anyone have any other suggestions?
 
@tigofmanycolors , sometimes a fresh start is needed without uninstalling and reinstalling the game. So to return the game to vanilla state, locate your Sims Medieval folder (found Documents > Electronic Arts > Sims Medieval) and move it to your Desktop. Do not copy and paste or create a shortcut, actually move the file. Once this is done, start up the game as normal to allow for a new folder to generate. Your saved games are safe on your Desktop. Try starting up a new game just to make sure the game works and play for about an hour or so again to test the game play and make sure all is well. You can save if you wish, but that is up to you. Now that you have a fresh, new folder, try the instructions as listed in the guides to see if you can enable the cheats.
 
the file must be edited in Notepad or another text editor. if you use Word, it may save it as a Word document or add a .txt extension to the edited file. At best your edit won't work as you created a new file, at worst you will need to repair your install, as you changed the file format.
 
There are three different modes in The Sims 4: Create-a-Sim mode, Build mode, and Live mode. You can enter Build/Buy cheats in both Live mode or Build mode, but you must be in Build mode to use them. The Build mode cheats include codes for moving objects, expanding the Build/Buy catalog, and more.

03 APRIL 2024Added various cheats posted on the forums and some cheats I've made, and obviously the normal maintenance stuff.Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.264).XML/JSON Cheat Collection for MAME 0.264 [3884K]

Note: The XML/JSON Cheat Collection archives are double packed. Inside the downloaded zip archive you will find a large cheat.7z. It's this cheat.7z that should be placed in the same directory as your MAME execute-able.**Read the cheat.txt file contained in the cheat0264.zip for more information. If you spot any errors (non-working cheats or parsing errors) then please post them in this forum topic .**
 
06 OCTOBER 2023Another maintenance release, added various cheats posted on the forums (mainly from Abystus) and some cheats I've made.Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.259).See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
Similar maintenance release to this time, although I've also made cheats for most of the Exelvision EXL 100 software list games and I've started to make cheats for the Amstrad GX4000 software list games.Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.257).See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
This is more or less a maintenance release, although there are now cheats for most of the Mega Duck software list games.Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.256).See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
Once again it's been far too long since the last release, so without further ado...Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.245).See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
Ok, it's been over a year since the last release, this time around it's simply a massive update. I've been adding cheats fairly silently for the various MAME software lists for a while now, this time I've converted SMS, NES & SNES cheats into XML format. The cheats will need testing, tidying & renaming but that a job for another day (or another lifetime). The raw NES/SNES cheats for conversion were donated by GameHacking.org, a great site and resource - thanks guys (especially rimsky82).So here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.221).See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
The cheat collection is 21 today! I simply can't believe 21 years have gone by so fast! If I'd realised that MAME was going to emulate so much I probably would never have started...
Anyway without further ado here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.206).See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.200). I simply couldn't leave a double zero MAME release pass by without an updated cheat database.See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
Here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME (0.199). It's been a whole year since the last release, sorry about that!
Hopefully, the next release should be sooner as I still have quite a few things to clean up and add now that I've done most of the grunt work.See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
 
Since MAME 0.186 crazyc has made some more really useful changes to the LUA cheat plugin (accessed via the Plugin Options\Cheat on the MAME TAB menu):1. You can now once again assign cheats to activation keys and it's actually a lot easier than it used to be, you can do it via the "Set Hotkeys" option in the menu or directly by editing the gamename\_hotkeys.json file in the cheat directory.2. The ability to add Game Genie codes direct to the cheat.simple file in the cheat directory, eg:nes/3dworldr,gg,AEUOLTPA,Infinite Lives
gameboy/addfamu,gg,C9E-F8E-081,Infinite Energy
gamegear/alien3,gg,002-B1C-3B7,Infinite Energy
megadriv/aaahhrmu,gg,ACFA-AACC,Infinite Lives
snes/aaahhrmu,gg,C282-04A7,Infinite EnergyOf course you can already use the cheatfind plugin option to find cheats if you can't get along with the debugger commandline cheat searching commands or want to try some different methods.If you can't see either the cheat/cheatfind or plugin options via the tab menu, add the following text to the plugin.ini file:-
cheat 1
cheatfind 1To read more about the plugin cheat engine or ask questions then have a look at this **forum topic**.30 MAY 2017Jumping the gun for this release, here is the cheat collection update for the latest MAME 0.186 (due release tomorrow). The highlight of this release is that it now contains cheats for 1929 games from the PSX softwarelist, I've collated the cheats from various GS/AR lists and converted them into XML format for ease of use.See the MAME Cheat Files section for a link for this version which has now been superceded.
