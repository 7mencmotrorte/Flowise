Oh, that sounds like a bummer, but don't worry, there's definitely a way around this!

**1. Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**: This one's a bit techy, but it's a powerful option if you've enabled USB debugging on your Android phone before the screen broke. ADB is a tool that lets your Windows PC communicate with an Android device and execute commands. You can use it to access the device's data and pull the files you need. It requires some setup, including installing ADB on your PC, but there are plenty of guides online to walk you through the process.
 
**2. Third-party Software**: There are several third-party applications out there designed for data recovery from Android devices. These programs can often bypass the need to interact with your phone's screen, though success varies depending on the software and the specific situation with your phone. Just be cautious and look for reputable ones with good reviews.
 
Remember, the best method depends on your phone's current settings (like if USB debugging is enabled) and the condition of your phone. If all else fails, professional data recovery services might be the last resort, but they can get pricey. Good luck, and here's to hoping your data makes a safe journey to your Windows 11 PC!
 
Remember, this process might not work for all devices, especially if they require specific permissions or if USB debugging was not enabled prior to the screen breaking. If ADB commands fail to access your device, you might need to consider alternative methods to recover data from Android phone with broken screen on Windows 11or consult with a professional.

For Samsung smartphones, you can recover data from Android phone with broken screen using Smart Switch software. Samsung Smart Switch is a versatile application designed to transfer data between mobile devices and backup or restore data on Samsung smartphones. If you've previously backed up your Android phone using Smart Switch, you can recover your data, including contacts, messages, photos, and more, by following a series of steps.
 
Open the Samsung Smart Switch application on your computer. Once the application recognizes your device, you will see an interface showing your device's details and several options, including "Backup", "Restore", and "Sync". For data recovery, you'll be focusing on the "Restore" option.
 
Click on the "Restore" button in Smart Switch. If you have multiple backups available, you'll need to choose which backup you wish to restore from. Smart Switch will display the most recent backup by default, but you can select a different backup by clicking on "Select a different backup" if you need to restore from an earlier date. After selecting the appropriate backup, click on the "Restore now" button. You may be prompted to allow permissions on your phone again; accept these to continue.
 
The restoration process will begin, and a progress bar will indicate how the process is advancing. The time it takes to complete will depend on the amount of data being restored. Avoid disconnecting your phone during this process. Once the restoration is complete, you might need to restart your device to apply all the changes. After restarting, you should find your data, including contacts, messages, and media files, restored to your device.
 
So today I turned on my Xiaomi Mi5 (I did not run any updates or anything before this, absolutely nothing) and all of a sudden, it was stuck in a bootloop. Now I want to completely wipe it, to fix this, but before that I want to recover my data. Is there any way I can access my files and recover my data? I can still access fastboot and the recovery (and ADB kinda). Also when I list the device in ADB devices, it shows up as b61077a4 sideload and im pretty sure it didnt always show up as sideload...
 
Something you can do is to try and get a working adb shell once you're in twrp and use adb pull to copy everything from your phone's memory to your pc, or you can just do backups with twrp. That's how I did it before flashing another ROM at least.
 
Thank you for your help, but I just fixed it. Because I installed twrp, I was able to access the files on my phone, through my pc (dont know why it didnt work before) and I recovered everything I needed. Though for some reason, I was only able to flash twrp using FWUL (a linux environment with a lot of android tools)
 
Try flashing in fastboot with the Mi flash tool. Feed it a fastboot rom according to your device found here. Set clean all in the bottom off the tool and start flash. (I recommend the global stable versions)
 
If it errors out on something like "failed to write boot" then you need to unlock your bootloader with the tool found here. You will need a mi account for this and a reason why you want to unlock it. Mine was "To install miui 8 global fastboot rom" and I got my unlock code 5 minutes after applying. You will need a device that receives a text. If you got permission its just as easy as putting your phone in fastboot and clicking next on the screen. If you did this just try the flash tool again.
 
Well, the problem was that my phone would always keep shutting down when in fastboot mode, the mi flash tool thought it was still flashing, not giving me any error. Also no my phone isn't rooted and yes I unlocked the bootloader long ago (came with some unofficial version of miui, that wouldnt get any updates, so I had to flash the proper version). 
But now everything is fixed. I ended up installing twrp using FWUL, like I said before. From there, I could just wipe the device and flash the rom using twrp
