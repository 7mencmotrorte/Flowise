Many mammals, including some primates, went extinct, but others adapted. Archaeologists working at sites in modern Ethiopia have discovered animal remains that date back almost 2.6 million years. The telltale cut marks on their bones are almost certainly signs of butchery1, says Manuel Domnguez-Rodrigo, a palaeoanthropologist at Complutense University in Madrid.

The implications for cognitive health are huge. There is a clear, but underappreciated link between meat and the mind, says Charlotte Neumann, a paediatrician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied meat eating in Africa and India for the past three decades. Deficiencies in the micronutrients found in meat have been linked with brain-related disorders, including low IQ, autism, depression and dementia. Iron is crucial for the growth and branching of neurons while in the womb; zinc is found in high concentrations in the hippocampus, a crucial region for learning and memory; vitamin B12 maintains the sheaths that protect nerves; and omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) help to keep neurons alive and to regulate inflammation.
 
In the 1980s, researchers began to suspect that a lack of meat in some poor rural villages was contributing to a spectrum of childhood problems, including short stature, weakened immunity, social difficulties and poor school performance. When researchers from five universities studied the effects of chronic malnourishment in Mexico, Kenya and Egypt, they found that children who consumed the greatest amount of meat and dairy products scored highest on physical, cognitive and behavioural tests, particularly in Kenya2. But was the absence of meat really to blame? What the researchers needed was a controlled study.
 
So Neumann began a trial in Kenya3. Her team selected 12 schools with children aged 6 to 14, and gave some of the children midmorning snacks. Schools were divided into four groups: the control group was not given a snack, whereas the other three received variations on githeri, a traditional porridge that consists of maize (corn), beans and greens. One group received a basic version, the second received the basic githeri with a glass of milk, and the third had meat added; all githeri were balanced to contain the same amount of calories. The study continued for more than 2 years and spanned 2 cohorts, the first with 525 students and the second with 375. The students' physical health and classroom performance were measured every three or six months. Compared with the other groups, students in the meat group had greater muscle mass and fewer health problems, and even showed greater leadership in the playground. Cognitive performance was stronger, too: the meat group outperformed other groups in maths and language subjects4.
 
Hosking found no correlation between the volunteers' test performance and their consumption of meat as children. The results contradicted what Neumann and others have observed in developing countries. What's more, contrary to conventional wisdom, participants who consumed more fish during childhood and as adults were actually slower on measures of cognitive speed. (The fish might have contained neurocontaminants such as mercury, she says.)
 
There are several issues that affect these results, says Hosking. One is that people don't eat single foods, but patterns of foods, making it difficult to tease out the importance of an individual food type, such as meat. In the older Australians for instance, those who ate meat were also more likely to consume packaged desserts and snack foods.
 
Beyond simple measures of micronutrient intake, individual requirements are also influenced by a person's genetics. So far, much of the research has focused on how people process omega-3 fatty acids, chiefly DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are crucial for human cognitive health.
 
So the key question becomes how much meat should a cognitive-health-conscious person eat. Too little can delay development and cognition. But too much, particularly if it is low quality and mass produced, is associated with other health concerns, such as heart disease and cancer, along with memory problems later in life. A person's life stage matters: pregnant women need more iron, as do babies and children. Genetics also play a part, but we don't yet know all the particulars. All these caveats make for a murky takeaway.

Sometimes keeping your students engaged during a (long) school day feels like a losing battle. How do you gain their full attention while teaching the skills they need to succeed? How do you turn tough and intimidating concepts into fun, entertaining lessons that actually spark life in the classroom?
 
And some examples of when teachers might want to use brain teasers are on a bulletin board in the classroom, as a partnered activity to start a new concept or lesson, or during a rainy day indoor recess box.
 
It's important to note that if you have any English language learners in your class, brain teasers for kids might pose a challenge for them. If that's the case, they might need you to walk them through the brain teaser more closely, or you can find ones that better suit their language level.
 
a) Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only - no kicking, UFC takedowns, or anything else). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible?
 
These brain teasers for kids explore the complexities of the English language. Use them to boost student knowledge of sounds, words, spelling, categorization and more.a) **Word association**: find a word that associates with the following sets of words.
 
The farmer can only fit one thing in the boat with him at a time. If left alone together, the fox will eat the goose or the goose will eat the beans. How does the farmer get everything across the river safely?
 
e) You planted sunflower seeds in your back garden. Every day, the number of flowers doubles. If it takes 52 days for the flowers to fill the garden, how many days would it take for them to fill half the garden?
 
The test involves saying the colour of a word, rather than reading the word itself. Your mind must process the two conflicting pieces of information, which slows down reaction speed and requires careful thought to get through.
 
In addition to their many learning advantages, brain teasers are a great way to break up the day and engage your students. Here are just a few ways you can use brain teasers for kids as a teaching strategy and maximize the benefits in your classroom:
 
Most people know that the brains has different sections, and that those different sections have different purposes. We might not know what the parts are called or exactly what they do, but most of us know that some areas of the brain deal with conscious thoughts, some deal with emotions and some deal with things we do unconsciously like breathing or heat control.
 
The BBC programme Twinstitute carried out an experiment in a similar vein in January 2019. The premise of the show, which is presented by two medical doctors who are also twin brothers, is to take pairs of identical twins and scientifically test two different ways of improving health by assessing two different ways of doing something head to head.
 
Another more recent experiment showed the potentially dramatic impact on our decision making when we refuel our tired brains. In a paper published in the National Academy of Science USA in 2011, Kurt Danziger, who studied at Oxford and Melbourne, did a study to look at the impact of rest and refuelling on the decisions made by a parole board. His experiment found that the last prisoner to be seen before the mid-morning break had an almost 0 per cent chance of obtaining parole. Immediately after the break, during which the judges ate a sandwich and piece of fruit, their chances of parole increased to around 65 per cent.
 
Many people I work with start the day by clearing their email inbox and then wonder why they feel stressed and tired. Email is undoubtedly a fantastic tool, but nearly all my clients say they receive unhelpfully many of them.
 
At mid-morning, lunchtime and mid-afternoon I suggest they pause for a while (some set an alarm on their phones). I ask them to think about how much time and energy they have put into their priority and whether they are in a position to feel how they wanted to feel at the end of the day.
 
Imagine that you are a comedian on this small stage. You are telling a joke and partway through someone shouts from the audience. You can see how this would be distracting and how you would need to either consciously refocus in order to ignore the heckler, divert from your original joke with a witty put-down, or ask security to remove them. Whichever way it goes, the original joke is disturbed and the effort of refocusing or thinking of a retort or shouting for back-up uses brain energy that you would not have needed to expend if they had kept their mouths shut.
 
Imagine how distracting you would find it as a comedian, and how much brain energy it would take, if there were five hecklers in the audience. It would be exhausting. Your joke would probably never get finished.
 
My tip if you feel overwhelmed or heckled by tasks on your to-do list is to use the comedian-on-stage imagery to help you notice. Try to spot an example of it today or tomorrow, whilst the image is fresh in your mind.
