It includes pattern for the central visual field testing like G, M, 24-2, and 10-2 as well as patterns for the periphery with the 07 test. Low vision tests, the binocular Esterman test for driving assessments, and custom tests complete the offering. Most tests take 2-4 minutes with the TOP strategy.

Appreciate the same parameters and flexibility as offered by the original manual Goldmann perimeter while benefitting from simplified and more consistent operation and even age-corrected normal values.
 
The user-oriented workflow of the Octopus 900 perimeter can reduces operator errors and supports reliable perimetric results. A guided step-by-step examination process, patient instructions in multiple languages and automated fixation control, that addresses with fixation loss automatically, further simplify the use of the device.
 
The EyeSuite software has been designed to support patient flow in busy practices. It controls many Haag-Streit devices and allows for them to be networked with other Haag-Streit devices, an office computer, or an EMR system without the need for any third-party software.
 
At Haag-Streit UK, we are always happy to support our customers with any queries on our range of products. As a first port of call, we have put together a comprehensive list of perimetry frequently asked questions.
 
1. Check EyeSuite version and that the system operates without errors
 2. Clean all optics and mirrors
 3. Carry out a perimetry test
 4. Ensure chinrest operates freely and holder moves in and out of position
 5. Ensure patient answering switch is operating correctly.

Ronald A Schuchard, David G Birch, Gislin Dagnelie, Robert K Koenekoop, Ava K Bittner, Leah M Wood, Claire S Barnes; Comparison of Kinetic Visual Fields (Goldmann and Octopus) and Threshold Visual Fields (Octopus macular static and Full-Field Stimulus Threshold) in Patients with Inherited Retinal Diseases. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2014;55(13):6110.
 
**Purpose**: The main objective was to compare Goldmann (GVF; manual) and Octopus (OVF; semi-automated) kinetic visual fields. The study also assessed the test-retest GVF and OVF solid angle measures. Finally the study determined whether Octopus static macular thresholds provided equivalent results to Full-Field Stimulus Threshold (FST; Diagnosys) measures.
 
**Methods**: Twenty-six participants with inherited retinal diseases (IRD; RP or LCA), age range 7 to 52 years, with reduced visual fields (10 deg to 120 deg diameters measured by V4e and one smaller size target, IV4e to I4e) underwent GVF and OVF tests repeated after one week. Octopus macular thresholds with five static points within 5 degrees of fixation and FST measures were obtained and also repeated after one week. Perimetrist ratings assessed fixation, cooperation, fatigue, and reported photopsias.
 
**Conclusions**: Our results provide evidence that OVF semi-automated kinetic perimetry with reaction time compensation can provide similar solid angle measures and similar test-retest variability to GVF performed by a qualified operator in the same testing time. Octopus static macular thresholds are not related to FST values. These findings suggest that OVF can provide reliable and accurate visual field measures in IRD clinical trials and that Octopus static thresholds from the macula do not provide equivalent threshold information to the FST.
 
The Octopus 600 offers the most commonly used static tests. For central field testing, there are the physiology-based G-patterns following the retinal nerve fibers and the 32, 30-2, and 24-2 patterns. For the macula, there are the physiology-based M pattern and the 10-2 pattern. With the fast TOP strategy, full threshold testing can be completed in 2-4 minutes.
 
Look at visual field results the way you are used to from your Octopus perimeter. All Octopus perimeters offer the standard 7-in-1 Printout with its well-known representations, a customizable 4-in-1 printout, a serial printout, and much more. And why not conveniently view results in your office by networking your Octopus to the EyeSuite software on your computer?

To compare the relationship of Octopus perimeter cluster mean-defect (cluster MD) values with the spatially corresponding optical coherence tomography (OCT) sector peripapillary angioflow vessel-density (PAFD) and sector retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) values.
 
High quality PAFD and RNFLT images acquired on the same day with the Angiovue/RTVue-XR Avanti OCT (Optovue Inc., Fremont, USA) on 1 eye of 27 stable early-to-moderate glaucoma, 22 medically controlled ocular hypertensive and 13 healthy participants were analyzed. Octopus G2 normal visual field test was made within 3 months from the imaging.
 
In the current population the relationship between inferotemporal sector PAFD and superotemporal cluster MD was strong. It was stronger than that between inferotemporal sector RNFLT and superotemporal cluster MD. Further investigations are necessary to clarify if our results are valid for other populations and can be usefully applied for glaucoma research.

The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research of Semmelweis University, Budapest. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrolment. All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers were followed. All participants were white Europeans participating in a long-term imaging study in the Glaucoma Center of the Semmelweis University in Budapest. OCT angiography and retinal nerve fiber layer imaging were conducted prospectively between June and December 2015. During the study visit high quality OCT angiography measurements of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina, and high quality imaging for RNFLT measurement were made. The participants underwent determination of the current best corrected visual acuity, evaluation of the central 30-degree visual field using Octopus perimetry, and a detailed ophthalmological examination.
 
The study population comprised 13 healthy eyes of 13 healthy subjects (with mean defect [MD] less than 2 dB using Octopus perimetry normal strategy, Loss Variance [LV] less than 6 dB2, and no significantly decreased test point sensitivity value) and untreated intraocular pressure consistently below 22 mmHg; 22 under treatment ocular hypertensive (OHT) eyes of 22 OHT patients with normal optic nerve head and visual field (with MD less than 2 dB using Octopus perimetry normal strategy, Loss Variance [LV] less than 6 dB2, and no significantly decreased test point sensitivity value) and untreated intraocular pressure consistently above 21 mmHg in both eyes; and 27 under treatment stable primary open-angle glaucoma eyes of 27 primary-open angle glaucoma patients characterized with untreated intraocular pressure consistently above 21 mmHg, glaucomatous neuroretinal rim loss and reliable and reproducible visual field defect typical for glaucoma (inferior and/or superior paracentral or arcuate scotomas, nasal step, hemifield defect or generalized depression with Octopus perimetry MD higher than 2 dB using normal strategy). One eye per participant (the eye with a higher PAFD image quality score) was analyzed. The demographics are shown in Table 1.
 
We used a new and commercially not yet released software (the Optovue 2015.100.0.33 software version, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) to measure PAFD (expressed in % of the measured area) via undilated pupil in the total peripapillary measurement area and in each of the 6 peripapillary sectors (Fig 1) in 2 different layers. In the current investigation measurements made for the inferotemporal and superotemporal sectors and the total peripapillary area in the RPC layer were used. The RPC layer reflects the retinal nerve fiber layer with the Angiovue OCT in which a uniform image segmentation algorithm is used for both investigations [14, 15]. In brief, the Angiovue OCT obtains amplitude decorrelation angiography images using an A-scan rate of 70,000 scans per second, a light source centered on 840 nm and a bandwidth of 50 nm [8]. Each OCT-A volume contains 304 x 304 A-scans with two consecutive B-scans captured at each fixed position before proceeding to the next sampling location. Split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography is use
